# **The Connoisseur's Compendium: A Definitive Guide to Selecting Spirits for Classic Cocktails in the UK**

## **Introduction**

The art of the cocktail is a study in alchemy. A written recipe provides the map, a set of instructions for combining disparate elements into a harmonious whole. Yet, the true character of the journey, the soul of the final creation, is defined not by the map but by the quality of its provisions. The choice of a specific gin, the character of a particular vermouth, the subtle complexities of an aged rum—these are the decisions that elevate a simple mixed drink into a memorable experience. To assemble a home bar of distinction is to curate a library of liquid stories, each bottle a potential protagonist in a classic narrative.  
This compendium is offered not as a mere list of instructions, but as a curated exploration into the heart of these classic drinks—the spirits themselves. It moves beyond generic categories to recommend specific, carefully chosen bottles that have been lauded by professional bartenders, celebrated by discerning enthusiasts, and verified for availability within the United Kingdom. The methodology is a synthesis of expert opinion from leading spirits publications, consensus from dedicated online communities, and practical, on-the-ground research into the catalogues of major UK supermarkets and specialist retailers. The aim is to empower the ambitious home bartender to build a collection with precision, confidence, and a nuanced understanding of how each spirit contributes to the timeless canon of cocktails.  

## **The Cocktail Compendium**

### **Alexander**

A silken, decadent classic, the Alexander occupies a unique space between cocktail and dessert. Born in the early 20th century and popularised during Prohibition, it is a triptych of flavour—a base spirit, a chocolate liqueur, and fresh cream, shaken into a frothy, indulgent whole. While the original was made with gin, it is the Brandy Alexander that has endured as the definitive version. Its success hinges on selecting a Cognac with enough character and mellow oak to provide a warming backbone that can stand up to its rich companions without being lost.

#### **Cognac: The Warming Backbone**

The spirit in an Alexander must possess sufficient body and complexity to cut through the richness of the cream and complement the deep notes of the crème de cacao. A younger, more aggressive VS (Very Special) Cognac can introduce a slight harshness, while the exceptionally delicate and nuanced notes of a very expensive XO (Extra Old) would be squandered and lost in the mix. The consensus among experts and enthusiasts is that the VSOP (Very Superior Old Pale) category represents the ideal tier, offering the perfect balance of oak, fruit, and spice for this particular composition.1  
1\. The Enthusiast's Choice: Courvoisier VSOP Cognac  
In a detailed side-by-side comparison of brandies for this specific cocktail, Courvoisier VSOP emerged as the "gold standard of what this drink should taste like," creating a final product that was perfectly "well-balanced and harmonized".2 It possesses the requisite presence and elegance, with phenols and fruits that form an ideal backbone. Tasted neat, it is rich with raisin and complex spice notes that linger on the palate.2 When shaken into an Alexander, these characteristics translate into a seamless, integrated cocktail that is more than the sum of its parts. For the connoisseur seeking the definitive expression of this classic, Courvoisier VSOP is the benchmark. It is widely available in the UK from major supermarkets like Sainsbury's and specialist retailers.3  
2\. The Bartender's Standard: Pierre Ferrand 1840 Original Formula Cognac  
Highly recommended across bartending forums and spirits reviews, Pierre Ferrand 1840 is a "good all around cognac" that "works beautifully in most cocktails".1 It was specifically created by cellar master Alexandre Gabriel and cocktail historian David Wondrich to replicate the richer, higher-proof style of Cognac used during the 19th-century golden age of cocktails.7 This makes it a stellar choice for drinks like the Alexander, where a spirit with presence is required. It offers notes of ripe grape, spice, and honey, with enough potency to ensure it is not overwhelmed by the other ingredients.7 While a specialist item in the UK, it is a prized "workhorse" bottle in any serious cocktail enthusiast's collection.9  
3\. The Widely Available Premium: Rémy Martin VSOP Fine Champagne Cognac  
Rémy Martin itself promotes its flagship VSOP for the Alexander, highlighting its "vanilla-oak warmth and dried-fruit brightness" as ideal complements to the drink's creamy profile.10 As a Fine Champagne Cognac, blended exclusively from the top two crus, it possesses an elegance and structure that keeps the creamy cocktail vibrant and poised.10 For those seeking an even richer profile, the brand suggests their 1738 Accord Royal, which offers deeper notes of toffee and dark chocolate.10 Rémy Martin VSOP is ubiquitous in the UK, available at retailers including Tesco and Sainsbury's.11  
4\. The Exceptional Value Choice: St-Rémy VSOP Brandy  
It is a crucial consideration for the home bartender that beyond a certain quality threshold, the nuances between spirits can become compressed when mixed with powerful ingredients like chocolate and cream. While Courvoisier VSOP may be the technical superior, the much more affordable St-Rémy VSOP, a French brandy from outside the Cognac region, is a "rock solid" performer in an Alexander.2 It is frequently recommended online as a superb "value-play" for a cocktail base.6 For those building a bar on a budget, or for whom the Alexander is an occasional indulgence rather than a regular staple, St-Rémy VSOP offers an intelligent and delicious choice that demonstrates the principle of diminishing returns without sacrificing quality.

#### **Crème de Cacao (Brown): The Chocolate Heart**

As a primary balancing component, the quality of the crème de cacao is paramount to a successful Alexander.1 It is essential to select a dark (or brown) version and, critically, one that is a true liqueur, not a chocolate cream liqueur. The term "crème" in this context refers to a high level of sugar, not the presence of dairy.1 Using a cream-based product would result in an overly thick, cloying drink, as fresh cream is already a key ingredient.14  
1\. The Premium Choice: Tempus Fugit Crème de Cacao à la Vanille  
For those seeking historical accuracy and unparalleled depth of flavour, Tempus Fugit is the definitive choice. Based on a 19th-century recipe, it is crafted from distilled Venezuelan cacao and Mexican vanilla beans, resulting in a liqueur that is decadently chocolatey, rich, and complex.15 It is frequently recommended by spirits experts as a top-tier option that will significantly elevate any cocktail it graces.17 It is available in the UK through specialist retailers such as The Whisky Exchange and Master of Malt.15  
2\. The Reliable Standard: Bols Crème de Cacao (Brown)  
Cited by Wine Enthusiast as being "ideal for mixing," Bols is a widely available and reliable brand that has been a staple on back bars for generations.1 Its flavour profile is one of rich, dark chocolate with subtle notes of orange and vanilla, which marries perfectly with the Cognac and cream.19 While perhaps less complex than the Tempus Fugit offering, it provides the authentic flavour and texture required for a classic Alexander at an accessible price point. It can be found at specialist UK retailers and through third-party sellers on major supermarket websites.19

### **Americano**

The direct ancestor of the Negroni, the Americano is a quintessential Italian aperitivo. First served in the 1860s at Gaspare Campari's bar in Milan, it is a masterful study in simplicity: equal parts bitter liqueur and sweet vermouth, lengthened with soda water and served over ice with a slice of orange. Its bittersweet, effervescent character is designed to stimulate the appetite. With only two core spirits, the quality and character of the sweet vermouth are paramount, as it is the primary variable that defines the drink's personality.

#### **Bitter Campari: The Unchanging Constant**

For a traditional Americano, Campari is the specified, non-negotiable bitter liqueur. The cocktail's entire history and flavour profile are built around Campari's unique and secret recipe of bitter herbs, aromatic plants, and fruit. Its distinctive notes of bitter orange, rhubarb, and gentian provide the essential foundation against which the vermouth and soda play. While other red bitter liqueurs exist, to substitute Campari is to make a different drink entirely. It is ubiquitously available in all major UK supermarkets and spirits retailers.

#### **Sweet Red Vermouth: The Soul of the Drink**

The choice of sweet vermouth is the primary way to customise an Americano to a personal taste profile, shifting its character along a spectrum from light and fruity to rich, spicy, and bitter.22 Having a selection of two or three different styles on hand allows for a remarkable degree of versatility from a single recipe.  
1\. The All-Rounder (French Style): Dolin Vermouth de Chambéry Rouge  
Hailing from the Alpine hills of Chambéry in France, Dolin Rouge offers a lighter, more delicate profile than its Italian counterparts.23 It is praised for its versatility, with an "easy-going profile" marked by stone fruit flavours and a subtle, balanced sweetness.22 In an Americano, it allows the bitterness of the Campari to remain prominent while providing a soft, fruity counterbalance. It creates a refreshingly light and approachable version of the drink, making it an excellent starting point and a versatile staple. It is readily available from UK specialist retailers like The Whisky Exchange and Amathus Drinks.24  
2\. The Classic Torino (Italian Style): Cocchi Vermouth Di Torino  
Produced in the historic heartland of Italian vermouth, Cocchi di Torino is made to an authentic 19th-century recipe and is celebrated for reviving this classic style.23 It is richer and more complex than Dolin, with vibrant notes of cocoa, citrus, rhubarb, and ginger.23 When used in an Americano, it lends a deeper, more rounded character to the drink, with its spicy and fruity notes creating a more complex interplay with the Campari. This is the choice for a more traditional, robust, and layered Americano. It is widely available from UK specialists.26  
3\. The Bitter Aficionado's Choice: Punt e Mes  
Translating to "point and a half," Punt e Mes is a unique vermouth from the Carpano family that is defined by its pronounced bitterness. It is described as "heavy duty stuff loaded with strong spice and a heady bitterness," effectively being one part sweet vermouth and half a part amaro.22 For those who find a standard Americano too sweet, or for lovers of bitter flavours, Punt e Mes is a revelation. It transforms the drink into a deeply complex and intensely bittersweet experience, with its strong spice notes creating a powerful and memorable aperitivo. It is available from most UK specialist spirits retailers.29  
4\. The Benchmark Premium: Carpano Antica Formula  
Often regarded as the gold standard of sweet vermouth by craft bartenders, Carpano Antica Formula is a rich, bold, and intensely complex spirit.23 With its prominent notes of vanilla, cocoa, dried fruit, and saffron, it creates the most luxurious and decadent Americano. While its complexity is sometimes considered better suited to stand up to whiskey in a Manhattan, it provides an unparalleled depth and richness when paired with Campari, making for an exceptionally sophisticated and memorable cocktail. It is a staple in specialist UK retailers.31

### **Angel Face**

A sophisticated, spirit-forward cocktail first published in Harry Craddock's 1930 *The Savoy Cocktail Book*, the Angel Face is a testament to the elegance of simplicity.32 It is a perfectly balanced, equal-parts marriage of gin, apricot brandy, and Calvados. With no citrus juice or sugar syrup to mediate, its success depends entirely on the harmonious interplay between the three distinct profiles: the botanicals of the gin, the stone fruit of the apricot liqueur, and the orchard fruit of the apple brandy.

#### **Gin: The Botanical Foundation**

The gin in an Angel Face must be a "team player." Its role is to provide a solid, juniper-led botanical foundation upon which the fruit notes of the other two spirits can build.32 An overly aggressive, high-proof, or heavily spiced gin can easily dominate and unbalance the delicate triad. The consensus points towards a classic, well-balanced London Dry Gin, particularly one with complementary citrus or floral notes that can "latch onto" the fruit brandies and create synergy rather than conflict.32  
1\. The Top Choice (Citrus-Forward): No. 3 London Dry Gin  
Specified in the recipe from the influential publication Liquor.com, No. 3 Gin is an exemplary choice for the Angel Face.35 Distilled with juniper, citrus, and spice at its heart, its bright, crisp notes of grapefruit and sweet orange peel are perfectly suited to complement the apricot and apple flavours of its partners.36 This gin provides the necessary botanical structure without overwhelming the fruit, resulting in a vibrant and beautifully integrated cocktail. It is available from Waitrose and specialist UK retailers.36  
2\. The Classic Standard: Hayman's London Dry Gin  
As the specific brand recommended by the authoritative Difford's Guide, Hayman's London Dry is a superb and reliable choice.38 Made to a 150-year-old family recipe, it is a classically balanced gin with crisp citrus and subtle spice notes that provide the perfect canvas for the other ingredients.39 It has the quintessential London Dry character to form the cocktail's backbone, allowing the Calvados and apricot liqueur to express themselves fully. It is available in major UK supermarkets, including Sainsbury's.40  
3\. Community Favourites: Beefeater London Dry & Tanqueray London Dry Gin  
Frequently mentioned in enthusiast discussions, both Beefeater and Tanqueray are excellent, juniper-forward workhorses that perform admirably in an Angel Face.38 Their clean, assertive profiles provide a robust framework that prevents the cocktail from becoming overly sweet or fruity. For those who prefer a more traditional, gin-led profile in their drinks, either of these widely available and affordable gins is an excellent option. Both are staples in all major UK supermarkets.44

#### **Apricot Brandy: The Stone Fruit Sweetness**

A critical point of clarification for this cocktail is the term "apricot brandy." While a true, dry fruit brandy (an *eau-de-vie*) exists, the Angel Face requires the sweetness of an apricot *liqueur* for balance.34 Using a dry brandy would result in a harsh and unbalanced drink. The challenge for the UK-based enthusiast is that the most frequently recommended brands in American sources are not readily available.  
1\. The Top UK-Available Choice: Giffard Abricot du Roussillon  
While US-centric sources often point to Luxardo or Rothman & Winter, these are difficult to source in the UK.48 Fortunately, Giffard Abricot du Roussillon is both highly praised by connoisseurs and readily available from UK specialists.52 One enthusiast describes their perfect "à la française" version of the cocktail using this very liqueur.38 Made by macerating 'Rouge du Roussillon' apricots, it has an authentic, rich stone fruit flavour that is essential for the cocktail's profile. For its combination of quality, praise, and accessibility, Giffard is the definitive recommendation for the UK market.  
2\. The Widely Available Alternative: Marie Brizard Apry  
As a long-standing and widely distributed brand, Marie Brizard's apricot liqueur is a functional and accessible option for the Angel Face.43 While perhaps not possessing the same depth as the Giffard, it will provide the necessary sweetness and fruit flavour to create a very enjoyable version of the cocktail.

#### **Calvados: The Orchard Core**

The recipe calls for Calvados, the apple brandy produced under strict AOC regulations in Normandy, France. While American Applejack is sometimes substituted, true Calvados is preferred for its greater complexity and depth of flavour.54 For a bright, spirit-forward cocktail like the Angel Face, a younger, fruit-forward Calvados is superior to a more expensive, heavily-oaked XO expression, whose aged characteristics could be lost or even clash with the other ingredients.  
1\. The Top Choice: Christian Drouin 'Sélection' Calvados  
This bottling from the highly respected producer Christian Drouin is an excellent choice for cocktails. An enthusiast on Reddit who used this specific bottle in an Angel Face praised its distinct "concentrated cider flavor," which they noted was highlighted beautifully in the final drink.43 This vibrant, fresh apple character is precisely what is needed to shine through alongside the gin and apricot. It is a blend of Calvados aged for around two to three years, offering bright fruit without overwhelming oak. It is available in the UK from specialist retailers like The Whisky Exchange.55  
2\. The High-Quality Alternative: Château du Breuil VSOP Calvados  
Mentioned as part of a high-quality "à la française" build by a discerning enthusiast, Château de Breuil is another excellent producer.38 A VSOP will have been aged for a minimum of four years, lending it a little more smoothness and a touch of oak to complement the bright apple notes. This would be a fine choice for adding a slightly richer dimension to the cocktail.

### **Aviation**

The Aviation is a pre-Prohibition icon, a gin sour that is as divisive as it is beautiful. First appearing in Hugo Ensslin's 1916 *Recipes for Mixed Drinks*, its fame and infamy rest on one key ingredient: crème de violette.57 This floral liqueur gives the drink its name and its signature, ethereal pale blue or light purple hue. Its omission from the influential  
*Savoy Cocktail Book* in 1930 led to the ingredient—and the original recipe—fading into obscurity for much of the 20th century.58 Its revival has re-established the drink as a complex and aromatic classic, a delicate balance of gin, sour lemon, the funky-sweet maraschino, and the floral violette.

#### **Gin: The Pilot of the Cocktail**

The gin in an Aviation must be carefully chosen. It needs to be assertive enough to serve as the base spirit, yet balanced enough not to clash with the two powerful and distinctive liqueurs. This has led to two main approaches to gin selection: one that seeks to harmonize with the floral notes, and another that prefers to provide a classic, clean backbone.  
1\. The Harmonious Choice: Cotswolds Dry Gin  
For those who wish to lean into the floral character of the Aviation, Cotswolds Dry Gin is an inspired choice. It is specifically recommended for this purpose due to its "huge lavender and grapefruit top notes".57 This profile creates a beautiful synergy with the crème de violette and the citrusy lemon juice, resulting in a seamless, integrated, and aromatic cocktail where all the components sing in harmony. It is widely available in the UK, including at major supermarkets like Sainsbury's.59  
2\. The Classic Backbone: Beefeater London Dry Gin  
For a more traditional, gin-forward Aviation, Beefeater is a benchmark. It is the gin of choice in the respected recipe from Jim Meehan's influential New York bar, PDT, and is frequently cited by enthusiasts.61 Its classic, juniper-and-citrus profile is clean, crisp, and robust, providing a perfect, sturdy canvas against which the unique flavours of maraschino and violette can stand out distinctly. It is an affordable and ubiquitous option available in all UK supermarkets.44  
3\. The Softer Alternative: Plymouth Gin  
Representing a middle ground, Plymouth Gin is another popular choice for the Aviation.62 As a geographically protected style of gin, it is slightly softer and more earthy than a classic London Dry, with a less aggressive juniper character. This allows it to blend beautifully with the other ingredients without dominating, creating a smooth and well-rounded version of the cocktail. It is widely available in the UK.64

#### **Maraschino Luxardo: The Industry Standard**

The user's list specifies Luxardo Maraschino, and the research overwhelmingly confirms that this is not merely a suggestion but the definitive industry standard. Its unique flavour profile—derived from the distillation of whole marasca cherries, including pits, stems, and leaves—is what the classic Aviation recipe was balanced around. It is described as having "deeper earthier tones" and a distinctive "funk" that is integral to the cocktail's traditional character.57  
**Confirmation of Standard:** Luxardo Maraschino is the essential, benchmark product for an authentic Aviation. Its complex profile is nutty, floral, and subtly bitter, providing a depth that simpler cherry liqueurs cannot replicate. It is specified in nearly every classic and modern recipe found.62 It is widely available in UK specialist retailers and many larger supermarkets.  
Highly-Regarded Alternatives:  
While Luxardo is the standard, a few alternatives exist for those seeking a different profile.

* **Maraska Maraschino:** Hailing from Croatia, Maraska offers a flavour profile of "more candied cherry tones".57 Using it in place of Luxardo is said to create a "radically different cocktail," one that is brighter and less funky.  
* **Lazzaroni Maraschino:** This is another Italian maraschino that is noted for creating a drink with less of the characteristic "funk" of Luxardo, which may appeal to those who find the latter's profile overpowering.66

#### **Crème de Violette: The Controversial Colour**

The choice of crème de violette is critical, as a poor-quality version can impart a soapy or overly sweet, confectionary flavour. The best examples are praised for their authentic, delicate floral taste, which should be a subtle, aromatic whisper rather than a shout.  
1\. The Connoisseur's Choice: Tempus Fugit Liqueur de Violettes  
In a comprehensive side-by-side tasting conducted by enthusiasts, Tempus Fugit's offering was declared "hands down the best violette for an aviation".70 Notably, it is a "Liqueur de Violettes" rather than a "Crème," indicating a focus on the floral distillate over a high sugar content.71 This results in a product with a "more floral profile" and a "cleaner finish" that is less "syrupy" than its competitors.66 For a cocktail that already contains the powerful and sweet Maraschino liqueur, this more balanced and authentic floral liqueur is the superior choice for creating a nuanced and elegant Aviation. It is available in the UK from specialist retailers.71  
2\. The Reliable Alternatives: Giffard & The Bitter Truth  
Both Giffard Crème de Violette and The Bitter Truth Violet Liqueur are excellent and more widely available options in the UK.62 Giffard is known for its high-quality range of French liqueurs, and its Crème de Violette is a solid performer. The Bitter Truth, a German brand famous for its bitters, produces a well-regarded violet liqueur that is also praised for the beautiful colour it imparts to the final drink.70 Either of these will produce a delicious and authentic-tasting Aviation.

### **Bee’s Knees**

A charmingly named cocktail from the Prohibition era, the Bee's Knees is a simple yet sublime variation on the classic Gin Sour. The "bee's knees" was 1920s slang for "the best," and the drink's genius lies in its replacement of simple syrup with honey syrup. This small change adds a floral, aromatic complexity that beautifully complements the botanicals of the gin and the bright acidity of the citrus.

#### **Dry Gin: The Botanical Core**

The Bee's Knees is traditionally made with a classic Dry Gin, often a London Dry. The honey and citrus are forward flavours, so the gin needs a solid juniper backbone to ensure it remains a gin cocktail and not simply a spiked lemonade. However, gins with pronounced citrus or floral notes can also work exceptionally well, creating a harmonious blend with the honey and lemon.  
1\. The Classic Choice: Bombay Sapphire  
The brand itself promotes its flagship London Dry Gin for use in a Bee's Knees, noting that the "lift of Bombay Sapphire" works perfectly with the bright citrus and velvety honey.77 With its ten carefully selected botanicals, including lemon peel and grains of paradise, Bombay Sapphire has a bright, clean, and versatile profile that allows the honey and lemon to shine while providing the essential gin character. It is one of the most widely available premium gins in the UK.78  
2\. The Modern Craft Choice: The Illusionist Dry Gin  
This German craft gin is recommended by its producers for a Bee's Knees, highlighting how its "smooth, citrusy flavor" combines with the sweet honey syrup.80 The Illusionist is known for its unique botanical blend and its natural colour-changing properties (from blue to pink with the addition of tonic or citrus), which adds a theatrical element to the serve. While not a traditional choice, its contemporary flavour profile makes for a delicious and visually striking Bee's Knees. It is available in the UK, though primarily through online specialists.81  
3\. The Flavourful Twist: Kirkjuvagr Beyla Honey & Raspberry Old Tom Gin  
For a truly exceptional Bee's Knees that leans into the honey profile, this gin from Orkney Distilling is an inspired suggestion from Craft Gin Club.83 As an Old Tom style, it has a subtle sweetness that naturally complements the honey syrup. Furthermore, it is infused with Orcadian honey and Scottish raspberries, which adds a wonderful layer of complexity that works beautifully with the honey and citrus juices in the cocktail.83 This creates a richer, more fruit-forward, and deeply aromatic version of the drink.

### **Bellini**

The epitome of Italian summertime elegance, the Bellini was invented sometime between 1934 and 1948 by Giuseppe Cipriani at the legendary Harry's Bar in Venice. It is a drink of sublime simplicity: fresh white peach puree gently stirred into chilled Prosecco. The key to a perfect Bellini is the quality of the two ingredients; specifically, a Prosecco that is fresh, fruity, and not overwhelmingly sweet, allowing the delicate flavour of the white peaches to shine.

#### **Prosecco: The Effervescent Heart**

The ideal Prosecco for a Bellini should have notes of apple, pear, and white flowers to complement the peach. It should also possess a bright acidity to keep the drink refreshing and a fine, persistent effervescence (or *perlage*) to provide a creamy texture. Most recommendations lean towards Brut (dry) or Extra Dry (off-dry) styles. A Brut style, with its lower sugar content, will allow the natural sweetness of ripe peaches to take centre stage, while an Extra Dry style can help balance the tartness if the peaches are not perfectly ripe.84  
1\. The Recognised Standard: La Marca Prosecco DOC  
Described as one of the most recognisable bottles on the market, La Marca is a consistent and easy-to-find choice that is perfect for mixing.84 It sits on the cusp of the Extra Dry and Dry classifications, meaning it has a noticeable touch of sweetness. This makes it an excellent choice for balancing a homemade peach puree that may be slightly tart. Its flavour profile of citrus, stone fruit, apple, and pear is a natural match for the peach. While listed as out of stock at Iceland, its prominence in the market suggests it can be found elsewhere in the UK.85  
2\. The Supermarket Star: Sainsbury's Taste the Difference Conegliano Prosecco  
Rated highly by Good Housekeeping, this DOCG Prosecco from a superior growing area is praised for its complexity, smooth bubbles, and well-balanced profile.87 With a classic flavour profile of apple and peach, it is a natural fit for a Bellini. Its rich, honeyed sweetness is balanced by a touch of acidity, making it a superb and readily available option from a major UK supermarket.87  
3\. The Value Choice: La Vostra Prosecco  
Produced by a large cooperative of growers, La Vostra offers excellent value and a solid foundation for a Bellini.84 It is described as bright and juicy, with notes of lemon, apple, and honeysuckle. A subtle sweetness on the palate makes it a great companion to fresh fruit puree, amplifying the peach flavours while bringing its own character to the glass.84 While its UK availability is less certain through major retailers, it represents the type of high-quality, value-driven Prosecco that is worth seeking out.88  
4\. The Crisp & Dry Option: Nino Franco Rustico Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore DOCG  
For those who prefer a drier Bellini that truly showcases the sweetness of the fruit, this highly admired producer offers an excellent choice. Made in a Brut style, it has "barely a whisper of sweetness".84 Its notes of pear and white flower mingle with gentle bubbles, creating a refreshing and elegant sparkling wine that provides the perfect crisp, effervescent backdrop for a high-quality peach puree.

### **Between the Sheets**

A suggestive name for a potent cocktail, Between the Sheets is a Prohibition-era classic that builds upon the template of the Sidecar. It takes the traditional combination of brandy, orange liqueur, and lemon juice, and splits the brandy base with a light white rum. This addition makes for a more complex and arguably more potent drink, a delicious creation for when a standard Sidecar needs a little more kick.90

#### **White Rum: The Caribbean Kick**

The rum in a Between the Sheets should be a light, white (or *blanco*) rum. Its role is to add a touch of grassy, sugarcane sweetness and Caribbean character without overwhelming the richer notes of the Cognac. While a standard, clean white rum is perfectly acceptable, a lightly aged white rum can add welcome depth and flavour.  
1\. The Bartender's Choice: Plantation 3 Stars White Rum  
A favourite among bartenders for its quality and complexity at an affordable price, Plantation 3 Stars is a blend of rums from Barbados, Jamaica, and Trinidad. It is filtered to remove colour but retains the flavour from its light ageing. This process gives it more character than many standard white rums, with notes of brown sugar, banana, and a hint of spice that add a beautiful layer to the cocktail. It is available in the UK from specialist retailers.91  
2\. The Ubiquitous Standard: Bacardi Superior Rum (Carta Blanca)  
One reviewer notes that they use Bacardi white rum "99% of the time because it's cheap and works".93 This sentiment reflects its position as the world's most popular white rum. It is light, clean, and smooth, with subtle floral and fruity notes. While it may not add the same depth as a more complex rum, it performs its role in the cocktail perfectly, allowing the Cognac to lead while providing the necessary rum character. It is available in every UK supermarket.94

#### **Cognac: The French Foundation**

As with the Sidecar, the quality of the Cognac is key. It needs to be smooth and flavourful enough to stand up to both the rum and the powerful orange liqueur. A good VSOP is often the preferred choice, offering a balance of fruit and oak.  
1\. The House Call: Hennessy V.S. Cognac  
Hennessy is one of the most popular Cognacs in the world, and the brand itself provides a recipe for the Between the Sheets using its flagship V.S. expression.96 Matured in new oak barrels, Hennessy V.S. is bold and fragrant, with toasted and fruit notes and a robust character that ensures it won't be lost in the mix.96 Its versatility makes it a perfect and widely available choice for this cocktail. It can be found in all major UK supermarkets.97  
2\. The Craft Choice: Louis Royer 'Force 53' VSOP Cognac  
For a more powerful and intense Between the Sheets, this overproof Cognac is an excellent, if harder to find, option. One recipe developer chose this specific bottling because its higher proof ensures it "would stand out against the rum".90 Bottled at a potent 53% ABV, this cask-strength VSOP is wonderfully smooth and intense, and will create a truly memorable version of the cocktail. Its availability in the UK is limited, often appearing as miniatures or being out of stock at major specialists.99  
3\. The Versatile Standard: Pierre Ferrand Ambre or 1840 Original Formula  
Pierre Ferrand's Cognacs are consistently praised for their quality and mixability.90 Either the Ambre or the 1840 Original Formula would be an excellent choice here, providing a rich, fruit-forward profile that works beautifully with the other ingredients.

#### **Triple Sec: The Sweet Citrus**

The orange liqueur provides sweetness, citrus brightness, and an extra alcoholic kick. While generic "triple sec" is listed, using a high-quality orange liqueur is crucial for a superior cocktail.  
1\. The Gold Standard: Cointreau  
Many modern recipes, including those from reputable sources, specify Cointreau in place of generic triple sec.90 Cointreau is a premium French liqueur made from a blend of sweet and bitter orange peels. It has a cleaner, less syrupy profile than cheaper triple secs and a higher strength (40% ABV), which helps it stand up to the two base spirits. One source notes that Cointreau has a "smoother finish" and is a "better match for cognac".93 It is the recommended choice for a perfectly balanced Between the Sheets.  
2\. The High-Quality Alternative: Pierre Ferrand Dry Curaçao  
Another excellent option is this curaçao from the esteemed Cognac house Pierre Ferrand. Based on a 19th-century recipe, it uses brandy and Ferrand Cognac as its base, which gives it a richer, drier, and more complex flavour than many other orange liqueurs.93 It offers notes of orange, vanilla, and nuts, and would create a more complex and sophisticated version of the cocktail. It is available from UK specialist retailers.101

### **Black Russian**

Created in the late 1940s at the Hotel Metropole in Brussels, the Black Russian is a cocktail of stark, bold simplicity. It contains just two ingredients: vodka and coffee liqueur, served over ice. Its success depends entirely on the quality of these two components and their interaction. The vodka should be clean and smooth, providing a neutral yet potent canvas for the rich, sweet, and complex flavours of the coffee liqueur.

#### **Vodka: The Neutral Canvas**

The vodka in a Black Russian should be smooth and soft, acting as a vehicle for the coffee liqueur rather than competing with it. An overly harsh or characterful vodka can detract from the drink's simple elegance.  
1\. The Recommended Standard: SKYY Vodka  
In its analysis of the cocktail, The Mixer explicitly names SKYY Vodka as the best choice, stating that its smooth and soft profile "won't overpower the coffee taste".104 SKYY undergoes a quadruple-distillation and triple-filtration process, which is designed to create a particularly clean and pure spirit, making it an ideal neutral base for a drink like the Black Russian. It is available in the UK, though more commonly through online specialists than major supermarkets.105  
2\. The British Craft Choice: Wild Knight English Vodka  
This premium vodka from Norfolk is distilled from East Anglian barley. It is exceptionally smooth and is recommended by its producers for a variation on the Russian theme.107 Using a high-quality, smooth British vodka like Wild Knight will provide a clean, premium base for the cocktail.

#### **Coffee Liqueur: The Rich Heart**

The coffee liqueur is the star of the Black Russian, providing all of the drink's flavour, sweetness, and colour. The choice of liqueur will have the most significant impact on the final taste.  
1\. The Ubiquitous Classic: Kahlúa Original  
Kahlúa is, without a doubt, the most famous and widely used coffee liqueur in the world. Its own brand materials feature it as the essential ingredient in a Black Russian.108 Made in Mexico from rum, sugar, vanilla bean, and arabica coffee, it has a sweet, rich, and approachable flavour profile with notes of toffee, butter rum, and chocolate.110 For the classic, sweet, and rich Black Russian that most people know, Kahlúa is the go-to choice and is available in every UK supermarket.  
2\. The Modern Craft Choice: Mr. Black Cold Brew Coffee Liqueur  
For a more intense, less sweet, and more authentically coffee-forward Black Russian, Mr. Black is the undisputed champion among modern bartenders and enthusiasts.110 Made in Australia, it uses a cold brew method with specialty arabica beans and contains significantly less sugar than traditional coffee liqueurs. This results in a liqueur that is robust, bittersweet, and tastes strongly of high-quality coffee. Using Mr. Black will transform the Black Russian from a sweet after-dinner drink into a sophisticated, complex, and bracing cocktail. It is widely available in the UK, including at Waitrose.111  
3\. The Specialist's Choice: St. George Spirits NOLA Coffee Liqueur  
Hailed as a favourite among American sommeliers and beverage directors, this liqueur from California is inspired by New Orleans-style coffee.110 It is made with roasted Ethiopian coffee beans, French-roasted chicory root, and Madagascar vanilla. This gives it a complex, earthy, and nutty flavour profile that is less sweet than Kahlúa but different in character from Mr. Black. It makes for a uniquely complex and delicious Black Russian. Its availability in the UK is limited to a few specialist online retailers.113

### **Bloody Mary**

The Bloody Mary is more than a cocktail; it is a brunch-time institution, a revered hangover cure, and a canvas for endless customization. Its origins are murky, with claims from both Paris and New York in the 1920s and 30s. The core, however, remains constant: vodka and tomato juice, seasoned with a combination of spices and sauces. While the garnishes can be extravagant, the foundation of a great Bloody Mary is a clean, robust vodka that can stand up to the powerful savoury flavours.

#### **Vodka: The Sturdy Base**

The vodka in a Bloody Mary should be clean but not necessarily neutral. A vodka with a bit of body and character can add to the overall texture and flavour of the drink. The key is to avoid anything harsh that would create an unpleasant alcoholic burn against the acidic tomato juice and spices.  
1\. The Spiced & Savoury Choice: Wild Mary Vodka  
This spiced vodka from the Surrey Hills is highly recommended by the creators of Bloody Ben's, a popular Bloody Mary mix.115 It is specifically designed to complement savoury cocktails, infused with its own blend of spices. Using a spiced vodka like Wild Mary adds an extra layer of complexity and warmth directly into the base of the drink, creating a more integrated and flavourful final product. It is available from specialist UK online retailers.116  
2\. The London Craft Choice: Baller Vodka  
Produced at the Doghouse Distillery in Battersea, London, Baller Vodka is made from 100% English wheat and is left unfiltered to retain its character.115 This gives it a full flavour and a "ridiculously smooth" finish, making it another top recommendation for a superior Bloody Mary.115 Its character and body will ensure it doesn't get lost amongst the spices. It is available from a number of UK specialist retailers.118  
3\. The Unique & Creamy Choice: Black Cow Pure Milk Vodka  
This unique vodka from Dorset is made entirely from the whey of grass-fed cow's milk, which results in an exceptionally smooth and creamy spirit.121 This creamy texture is a fantastic attribute in a Bloody Mary, adding a subtle richness and mouthfeel that complements the thickness of the tomato juice. It is a multi-award-winning vodka that is widely available in the UK, including at major supermarkets like Sainsbury's.115  
4\. The Organic Choice: Sacred Organic Vodka  
Made in Highgate, North London, this organic vodka is another recommendation from the Bloody Ben's team.115 It is a clean, high-quality spirit that will provide a perfect, smooth base for the cocktail without introducing any unwanted impurities. It is available from specialist retailers in the UK.124

### **Boulevardier**

Often described as a "whiskey Negroni," the Boulevardier is a rich, bittersweet, and sophisticated cocktail. It was created in Paris in the 1920s for Erskine Gwynne, an American writer who founded the magazine *Boulevardier*. The drink swaps the gin of a Negroni for bourbon or rye whiskey, creating a warmer, spicier, and more rounded profile. The choice between bourbon and rye is the primary point of customization and significantly alters the drink's character.

#### **Bourbon or Rye Whiskey: The Spirituous Heart**

The choice of whiskey is crucial. A bourbon, with its corn-based sweetness and notes of caramel and vanilla, will create a richer, smoother, and more mellow Boulevardier. A rye whiskey, with its characteristic spice and peppery notes, will result in a drier, spicier, and more assertive cocktail that stands up more aggressively to the bitter Campari.  
**Bourbon Recommendations:**

* 1\. The Go-To Standard: Maker's Mark  
  One reviewer notes that Maker's Mark is an "obvious and easy to find bourbon that provides a smooth counterpoint to the sweet vermouth and Campari".127 As a wheated bourbon, it is softer and slightly sweeter than many others, with prominent notes of caramel and vanilla. This makes it an excellent choice for a smooth, rich, and well-balanced Boulevardier. It is widely available in all major UK supermarkets.128  
* 2\. The High-Rye Value Choice: Old Grand-Dad Bonded Bourbon  
  This high-proof (100 proof, or 50% ABV) and high-rye bourbon is recommended as a less expensive but "equally delicious" option.127 Its higher rye content gives it more spice than Maker's Mark, and it is less sweet, making it a "particularly good choice for the Boulevardier" as it balances the sweet vermouth and Campari beautifully.127 Its availability in the UK is scarce, often limited to specialist importers or auction sites, making it a bottle to acquire when the opportunity arises.131  
* 3\. The Premium High-Rye: Four Roses Single Barrel  
  For a more premium, high-rye bourbon experience, Four Roses Single Barrel is a "great choice".127 It is known for its complex profile of ripe fruit, spice, and floral notes, which creates a sophisticated and deeply flavourful Boulevardier.

**Rye Whiskey Recommendation:**

* 1\. The Bartender's Favourite: Rittenhouse Straight Rye Whisky (Bottled-in-Bond)  
  Rittenhouse Rye is a bartender's staple and a favourite for cocktails for several key reasons. As a Bottled-in-Bond spirit, it is bottled at 100 proof (50% ABV), which gives it the strength and flavour to "stand up in cocktails" without getting lost.134 It has a classic Pennsylvania-style rye profile, rich with notes of cocoa, dried fruit, cinnamon, and a lingering maple-like spiciness.134 This spicy character is the perfect foil for the bitter Campari and sweet vermouth, creating a robust, complex, and perfectly balanced Boulevardier. It is widely available in the UK from specialist retailers.135

#### **Bitter Campari: The Constant**

As with the Americano and Negroni, Campari is the essential, defining bitter component of the Boulevardier. Its unique flavour profile is what the whiskey and vermouth are balanced against.

#### **Sweet Red Vermouth: The Balancing Act**

The vermouth in a Boulevardier needs to be robust enough to stand up to both the whiskey and the Campari. While any of the choices recommended for the Americano would work, the richer, more complex styles are particularly well-suited to this cocktail.

* 1\. The Gold Standard: Carpano Antica Formula  
  Often regarded as the top choice for a Boulevardier, Carpano Antica's rich vanilla, cocoa, and spice notes are a perfect match for a bold bourbon or rye.28  
* 2\. The Classic Choice: Cocchi Vermouth Di Torino  
  Cocchi's profile of red fruit, cocoa, and bitter orange also works beautifully, creating a well-balanced and classic version of the drink.28  
* 3\. The Bitter Twist: Punt e Mes  
  For a particularly bitter and complex Boulevardier, Punt e Mes is an excellent choice. Its amaro-like qualities add an extra layer of bitterness that complements the whiskey's spice and the Campari's bite.28

### **Bramble**

A modern classic, the Bramble was created in the 1980s by the legendary London bartender Dick Bradsell at Fred's Club in Soho. It is a quintessentially British drink, inspired by Bradsell's memories of blackberrying on the Isle of Wight. The cocktail is a simple and refreshing build: a gin sour served over crushed ice, with a drizzle of blackberry liqueur (*crème de mûre*) that "brambles" its way through the drink.

#### **Gin: The Foundation**

A classic London Dry Gin is the traditional choice for a Bramble. Its juniper-forward profile provides a crisp, botanical base that is beautifully complemented by the tart lemon and sweet-tart blackberry.  
1\. The Recommended Standard: 'LONDON' Dry Gin by Jim and Tonic  
This London-based distillery recommends its own London Dry Gin for the Bramble.138 It is made with botanicals including London apples and linden blossom, which adds a subtle local character that aligns with the drink's British roots. This gin provides the classic profile needed for a refreshing and authentic Bramble.  
2\. The Widely Available Classic: Beefeater or Tanqueray  
Any high-quality, juniper-forward London Dry Gin will work perfectly in a Bramble. Beefeater and Tanqueray are both excellent, reliable, and affordable choices that will provide the perfect botanical backbone for the cocktail.

#### **Crème de Mûre: The Blackberry Heart**

The crème de mûre is the soul of the Bramble. While some recipes suggest substituting crème de cassis (blackcurrant liqueur), the authentic flavour comes from a true blackberry liqueur. Many enthusiasts and publications even provide recipes for making your own, using fresh blackberries, red wine, and gin or vodka, which speaks to the importance of a high-quality, authentic flavour.139  
1\. The French Artisan Choice: Giffard Crème de Mûre  
Giffard is a highly respected French liqueur producer, and their Crème de Mûre is an excellent choice for a high-quality Bramble. It is made from an infusion of blackberries and has a rich, jammy, sweet-tart flavour that is perfect for the cocktail. It is available from specialist UK retailers.141  
2\. Other High-Quality Options: Merlet & Briottet  
Both Merlet and Edmond Briottet are other esteemed French producers who make exceptional crème de mûre. Merlet's version is made from two complementary varieties of wild blackberries and is noted for its silky, fruity palate.143 Briottet's is also praised for its beautiful balance of sweet and tart, pairing perfectly with gin and lemon.145 Any of these three French brands will elevate a Bramble far beyond what can be achieved with a generic liqueur.

### **Brandy Crusta**

The Brandy Crusta is a historic and ornate cocktail, considered an important forerunner to both the Sidecar and the Margarita. Created in the 1850s by Joseph Santini in New Orleans, its defining feature is the elaborate garnish from which it takes its name: a wide crust of sugar on the rim of the glass and a long, continuous lemon peel curled inside. The drink itself is a sophisticated sour, combining brandy, orange liqueur, maraschino liqueur, and lemon juice.

#### **Brandy: The Spirit Base**

While the recipe simply calls for "brandy," a high-quality, smooth Cognac is the typical choice to provide a rich and elegant base for this classic cocktail.  
1\. The House Call: Hennessy V.S. Cognac  
The official Hennessy website provides a recipe for the Brandy Crusta using their V.S. expression.147 Its bold, fragrant, and full-bodied character provides the perfect robust foundation for the drink's other complex ingredients.  
2\. The American Craft Option: Copper & Kings American Craft Brandy  
One reviewer specifically recommends Copper & Kings as their "go-to" brandy for a Crusta, praising it as "very smooth and easy to use in cocktails".148 This American brandy, distilled in Kentucky, offers a different profile to French Cognac but is highly regarded for its quality and mixability. Its availability in the UK is very limited, making it a specialist import item.149

#### **Maraschino Luxardo: The Complex Sweetener**

As with the Aviation, Luxardo Maraschino is the specified and standard choice for the Brandy Crusta. Its unique, funky complexity adds a layer of flavour that simple syrup cannot replicate. It is the benchmark for this and many other classic cocktails.148

#### **Curaçao: The Orange Note**

The recipe calls for a bar spoon of Curaçao. This is a critical flavouring component, and a high-quality orange liqueur is essential.  
1\. The Bartender's Choice: Pierre Ferrand Dry Curaçao  
Given its historical accuracy and use of a Cognac base, Pierre Ferrand Dry Curaçao is the ideal choice for a Brandy Crusta.152 Its drier, more complex profile will integrate seamlessly with the brandy base and add a sophisticated layer of orange, spice, and vanilla notes. It is widely available from UK specialist retailers.101

#### **Aromatic Bitters: The Spice Accent**

Two dashes of aromatic bitters are required to complete the drink, adding a final layer of spice and complexity.  
1\. The Unquestionable Standard: Angostura Aromatic Bitters  
In any classic cocktail recipe that simply calls for "aromatic bitters," Angostura is the assumed and historical standard.152 Its unique and secret blend of herbs and spices is an essential component of the drink's balance.

### **Caipirinha**

The national drink of Brazil, the Caipirinha (pronounced *kai-pur-EEN-ya*) is a powerfully refreshing and deceptively simple cocktail. It is made with just three ingredients: cachaça, fresh lime, and sugar. The limes are cut into wedges and muddled directly in the glass with the sugar to express their oils and juice, before being combined with the cachaça and ice. The choice of cachaça is the defining factor in the quality of the final drink.

#### **Cachaça: The Brazilian Spirit**

Cachaça is a Brazilian spirit distilled from fresh sugarcane juice, which distinguishes it from most rums, which are distilled from molasses. This gives it a characteristic grassy, funky, and vegetal flavour profile. A high-quality, well-balanced cachaça is essential for a great Caipirinha.  
1\. The Accessible Standard: Leblon Cachaça  
Leblon is one of the most widely available and affordable premium cachaças on the international market.153 It is aged briefly in Cognac casks, which gives it a smooth, full-bodied taste with fruity and herbal notes, alongside hints of vanilla and citrus.153 Its accessibility and balanced profile make it an excellent and reliable choice for a classic Caipirinha. It is available from UK specialists.154  
2\. The Organic Choice: Abelha Organic Cachaça  
This small-batch, organic cachaça is made using traditional methods, including distillation in copper pot stills.156 It has a vibrant, aromatic, and fresh sugarcane flavour that is perfect for a high-quality Caipirinha. It is available in both a silver (  
*prata*) and an aged gold (*ouro*) expression. For a Caipirinha, the unaged silver is the classic choice. It is available from a number of UK specialist retailers.156  
3\. The Craft Connoisseur's Choice: Novo Fogo Cachaça  
Novo Fogo is another highly regarded organic cachaça brand. Their Silver cachaça is described as more subtle and mellow than other brands, with light, simple flavours and notes of sweet red pepper and a slight floral aroma.153 This makes for a clean and subdued Caipirinha where the lime and sugar can also shine. The brand also offers a range of aged expressions for sipping. Its availability in the UK is primarily through online specialists.159

### **Canchanchara**

Considered by many to be the original Cuban cocktail and a forerunner to the Daiquiri, the Canchanchara is a rustic and potent drink with a rich history.161 It was created by the  
*Mambises*, Cuban freedom fighters during the 19th-century wars of independence, as a fortifying tonic. It combines the raw spirit of the island, *aguardiente*, with the medicinal properties of local honey and the vitality of fresh lime juice.161

#### **Cuban Aguardiente: The Historic Spirit**

The original recipe calls for *aguardiente de caña*, the raw, fiery ancestor of modern Cuban rum. As true aguardiente is difficult to source outside of Cuba, a high-quality, characterful Cuban rum is used in its place. The goal is to use a rum that retains some of the fresh, green sugarcane character of its origins.  
1\. The Recommended Standard: Havana Club 7 Años  
The official Havana Club website recommends their 7 Años dark rum for the Canchanchara.161 While not an aguardiente, this rum is matured for seven years, giving it a full spectrum of Cuban flavours, including aromatic tobacco, tropical fruits, and rich brown spices.161 This complexity stands up well to the honey and lime, creating a rich, sophisticated, and deeply flavourful version of the historic drink.  
2\. The Lighter Alternative: Havana Club 3 Años  
For a lighter, more Daiquiri-like Canchanchara, Havana Club 3 Años would also be an excellent choice. This light aged white rum combines the fresh, green notes of sugarcane with the fruity notes of Caribbean rum, which is closer in spirit to the original aguardiente base.162 It is the go-to rum for classic Cuban cocktails like the Mojito and Daiquiri, and would create a more bracing and refreshing Canchanchara. It is available in all major UK supermarkets.163

### **Cardinale**

The Cardinale is a crisp, bittersweet, and elegant variation on the Negroni. Created in Rome in the 1950s, the cocktail swaps the sweet vermouth of a Negroni for dry vermouth.165 This simple change results in a significantly different drink: it is lighter, drier, more herbaceous, and arguably more bracing than its more famous cousin. The original recipe actually used Riesling wine instead of vermouth, but the dry vermouth version has become the modern standard.165

#### **Gin: The Botanical Base**

As with a Negroni, a classic, juniper-forward London Dry Gin is the ideal choice for a Cardinale. It needs to have enough botanical character to stand up to the powerful bitterness of the Campari.  
1\. The Recommended Standard: Hayman's London Dry Gin  
Difford's Guide specifies Hayman's London Dry Gin in its recipe for the Cardinale.165 Its classic, well-balanced profile provides the perfect botanical structure for the drink, allowing the dry vermouth and Campari to express themselves without being overshadowed.  
2\. Other Classic Choices: Beefeater, Tanqueray, or Plymouth  
Any high-quality London Dry or Plymouth Gin would be an excellent choice for a Cardinale.167 Beefeater or Tanqueray will provide a robust juniper backbone, while the slightly softer, earthier profile of Plymouth Gin will create a subtly different but equally delicious version.

#### **Dry Vermouth: The Herbaceous Modifier**

The choice of dry vermouth is key to the character of the Cardinale. A good quality French or Italian dry vermouth will provide the necessary herbaceous and wine-like notes to balance the other two ingredients.  
1\. The French Standard: Noilly Prat Original Dry  
Noilly Prat is a classic and highly respected French dry vermouth. It is aged outdoors in oak casks, which gives it a unique, lightly oxidised, and complex character with notes of chamomile and gentian. It is a favourite of many bartenders and would create a deeply flavourful and traditional Cardinale.168  
2\. The Lighter French Style: Dolin de Chambéry Dry  
Dolin Dry is another benchmark French vermouth, known for its lighter, fresher, and more floral profile compared to Noilly Prat.168 It will create a crisper, more delicate Cardinale, allowing the gin's botanicals to shine through more prominently.  
3\. The Italian Option: Cinzano 1757 Extra Dry or Carpano Dry  
For an all-Italian Cardinale, a high-quality Italian dry vermouth is an excellent choice. Both Cinzano's premium 1757 expression and Carpano Dry are highly regarded options that will provide a distinctly Italian herbaceous character to the cocktail.168

#### **Bitter Campari: The Constant**

As with its sibling cocktails, Campari is the essential and non-negotiable bitter component that gives the Cardinale its name, colour, and characteristic bittersweet flavour profile.

### **Casino**

The Casino is a classic pre-Prohibition cocktail that is elegant, complex, and spirit-forward. It is essentially a variation on the Aviation, omitting the crème de violette and using a slightly sweeter Old Tom Gin as its base. The recipe, as published in the *Savoy Cocktail Book*, combines Old Tom Gin, maraschino liqueur, fresh lemon juice, and orange bitters.169

#### **Old Tom Gin: The Sweetened Base**

Old Tom is a historic style of gin that is slightly sweeter than London Dry, but much drier than the Dutch Jenever. This subtle sweetness is key to the Casino's balance, as it softens the gin's botanicals and complements the maraschino liqueur.  
1\. The Historical Standard: Hayman's Old Tom Gin  
Hayman's is one of the most respected and widely available Old Tom gins, made to a historic family recipe. It is the gin specified in the Difford's Guide recipe for the Casino.170 It has a rich and rounded profile with a subtle sweetness that is perfect for classic cocktails like the Casino, Martinez, and Tom Collins. It is readily available from UK specialist retailers.171  
2\. The American Craft Choice: Ransom Old Tom Gin  
Developed in collaboration with cocktail historian David Wondrich, Ransom Old Tom is an attempt to recreate the authentic 19th-century American style of Old Tom gin. It is barrel-aged, which gives it a pale straw colour and a uniquely complex flavour profile with notes of cardamom and malt. It creates an exceptional and historically fascinating Casino. Its availability in the UK is very limited and requires sourcing from specialist importers.173

#### **Maraschino Luxardo: The Essential Liqueur**

As with its relatives the Aviation and the Brandy Crusta, Luxardo Maraschino is the specified and essential liqueur for an authentic Casino cocktail.170 Its complex, funky character is a key component of the drink's flavour profile.

#### **Orange Bitters: The Citrus Accent**

A few dashes of orange bitters are crucial for adding an extra layer of citrus complexity and tying the other ingredients together.  
1\. The Bartender's Standard: Regan's Orange Bitters No. 6  
Created by the late, great cocktail authority Gary "Gaz" Regan, this is considered the standard orange bitters by many professional bartenders.175 It has a sophisticated and complex profile with notes of orange peel and cardamom that is perfect for a wide range of classic cocktails, including the Casino. It is available from UK specialist retailers.177  
2\. The Classic Alternative: Angostura Orange Bitters  
From the iconic House of Angostura, this orange bitters offers a brighter, more straightforward orange flavour derived from sun-ripened Caribbean oranges.179 It is an excellent and widely available alternative that works beautifully in the Casino. It can be found in some major UK supermarkets and online.179  
3\. The Sweeter Option: Fee Brothers West Indian Orange Bitters  
Fee Brothers' version is known for being slightly lighter and sweeter than other orange bitters, with a more pronounced candied-orange character.176 This makes it a good choice for those who prefer a slightly less bitter accent in their cocktails. It is available from UK specialists.182

### **Champagne Cocktail**

A true classic of celebration, the Champagne Cocktail is one of the oldest cocktails on record, first appearing in print in 1862\. It is a simple yet elegant preparation designed to enhance, rather than mask, the flavour of the Champagne. A sugar cube is soaked with Angostura bitters at the bottom of a flute, a small measure of Cognac is added, and the glass is then topped with chilled Champagne.

#### **Chilled Champagne: The Star of the Show**

The choice of Champagne is paramount. A high-end vintage Champagne would be wasted here, as its subtle nuances would be altered by the other ingredients. The ideal choice is a good-quality, non-vintage Brut Champagne. "Brut" indicates a dry style, which is necessary to balance the sweetness of the sugar cube and the optional Grand Marnier.  
1\. The Reliable Classics: Moët & Chandon, Veuve Clicquot, Lanson  
These major Champagne houses produce consistent, high-quality non-vintage Brut Champagnes that are perfect for a Champagne Cocktail. They possess the classic notes of brioche, green apple, and citrus, with a bright acidity and fine effervescence that provide the perfect foundation for the drink. They are all widely available in every major UK supermarket.  
2\. The Value Alternative: Crémant or Cava  
For a more budget-friendly but still delicious version, a high-quality traditional-method sparkling wine from outside the Champagne region is an excellent choice. A Crémant from France (such as Crémant de Bourgogne or Crémant d'Alsace) or a Cava from Spain will offer a similar dry, crisp, and toasty profile at a fraction of the price.

#### **Cognac: The Fortifying Spirit**

A small amount of Cognac is added to fortify the drink and add a touch of warmth and complexity. A good quality VS or VSOP Cognac is ideal. Any of the Cognacs recommended for the Brandy Alexander, such as **Courvoisier VS or VSOP**, **Hennessy V.S.**, or **Rémy Martin VSOP**, would be an excellent choice here.

#### **Angostura Bitters: The Essential Spice**

The two dashes of bitters soaked into the sugar cube are what give the Champagne Cocktail its characteristic spice and depth. Angostura Aromatic Bitters is the historical and unquestionable standard for this role.184

### **Chartreuse Swizzle**

A modern classic from the San Francisco bar scene, the Chartreuse Swizzle was created by bartender Marcovaldo Dionysos. It is a vibrant, complex, and supremely refreshing tropical-style drink that puts the bold, herbaceous flavour of Green Chartreuse front and centre. The Chartreuse is balanced by pineapple and lime juices and the spicy-sweet notes of falernum, all served in a tall glass packed with crushed ice.

#### **Green Chartreuse: The Herbal Powerhouse**

Green Chartreuse is the defining, non-negotiable ingredient of this cocktail. Produced by Carthusian Monks in the French Alps since 1737, its secret recipe of 130 herbs, plants, and flowers gives it a uniquely intense, complex, and powerful sweet-and-herbal flavour. There is no substitute.

#### **Falernum: The Spice of the Caribbean**

Falernum is a sweet syrup or liqueur from the Caribbean, flavoured with almond, ginger, lime, and cloves. It is a key ingredient in many classic tiki drinks and provides a crucial layer of sweet spice that bridges the gap between the herbal Chartreuse and the tropical fruit juices.  
1\. The Industry Standard: John D. Taylor's Velvet Falernum  
This is the most well-known and widely available brand of falernum liqueur.185 It has a prominent flavour of lime, clove, and almond, and its sweetness is essential to balance the cocktail. It is the go-to choice for most bars and is considered the benchmark for the category.  
2\. The Non-Alcoholic Option: Fee Brothers Falernum Syrup  
For those who wish to add the falernum flavour without additional alcohol, Fee Brothers produces a non-alcoholic syrup that is described as "serviceable" for this cocktail.185

### **Clover Club**

A beautiful, silky, and sophisticated pre-Prohibition classic, the Clover Club originated at a Philadelphia men's club of the same name in the late 19th century. It is a gin sour, softened and given a rich texture by the addition of egg white, and flavoured and coloured by raspberry syrup. When properly made, it is a perfectly balanced drink that is tangy, fruity, and visually stunning with its thick, pink foam head.

#### **Gin: The Botanical Base**

The Clover Club works best with a classic London Dry Gin. The juniper and botanical notes of the gin prevent the drink from becoming a simple fruity sour, providing a complex backbone for the raspberry and lemon flavours.  
1\. The Recommended Standard: Hayman's London Dry Gin  
Difford's Guide specifies Hayman's in its preferred recipe for the Clover Club, which also includes a touch of dry vermouth for added complexity.187 Its classic, balanced profile is an ideal choice.  
2\. Other Classic Choices: Beefeater or Tanqueray  
As with many classic gin sours, a reliable and juniper-forward gin like Beefeater or Tanqueray is a perfect and affordable choice. Their robust character will ensure the gin's presence is felt through the fruit and foam.

#### **Raspberry Syrup: The Fruity Heart**

The quality of the raspberry syrup is critical to the success of a Clover Club. A fresh, vibrant raspberry flavour is essential. While commercial syrups are available, many enthusiasts and experts advocate for making your own, which is a simple process of heating fresh or frozen raspberries with sugar and water.188  
1\. The Homemade Option:  
Making your own raspberry syrup is the best way to ensure a bright, authentic fruit flavour. It is far superior to most commercial options and is highly recommended for this cocktail.188  
2\. The Commercial Standard: Monin Raspberry Syrup  
If buying a pre-made syrup, Monin is a reliable and widely available brand that is specified in the Difford's Guide recipe.187 It will provide the necessary sweetness and raspberry flavour for a good Clover Club.  
3\. The Pantry Hack: Raspberry Preserves  
In a pinch, a high-quality raspberry preserve or jam, such as Bon Maman, can be used in place of syrup.188 A bar spoon of preserves is shaken with the other ingredients and then fine-strained to create the cocktail. This method is used in the Cosmonaut cocktail, a close relative of the Clover Club.188

### **Corpse Reviver \#2**

One of the most famous "hair of the dog" cocktails, the Corpse Reviver \#2 is a bracing, complex, and perfectly balanced drink from the *Savoy Cocktail Book*. The recipe is a memorable equal-parts combination of gin, Cointreau, Lillet Blanc, and fresh lemon juice, with a dash of absinthe to rinse the glass. It is a bright, aromatic, and surprisingly potent cocktail that has become a modern classic.

#### **Gin: The Spirit Core**

A classic London Dry Gin is the standard choice, providing a clean, juniper-forward base that allows the other complex ingredients to shine.  
1\. The Classic Choice: Beefeater or Tanqueray  
A robust and reliable London Dry like Beefeater or Tanqueray is an excellent choice. Their assertive botanical profiles ensure the gin character is not lost amidst the powerful orange, wine, and anise flavours.  
2\. The Softer Choice: Plymouth Gin  
For a slightly softer and rounder Corpse Reviver \#2, Plymouth Gin is a superb alternative. Its less juniper-dominant, more earthy profile integrates beautifully with the other ingredients.

#### **Cointreau: The Specified Orange Liqueur**

The recipe specifically calls for Cointreau, and this is a crucial detail. Its clean, bright, and strong (40% ABV) orange profile is essential to the drink's balance. Substituting a lower-quality, sweeter triple sec will result in an inferior cocktail. Cointreau is the non-negotiable standard.189

#### **Lillet Blanc: The Aromatised Wine**

Lillet Blanc is a French aromatised wine from Bordeaux. Its profile of honeyed citrus, passion fruit, and a light quinine bitterness is a key component of the Corpse Reviver \#2's flavour. It is the contemporary standard for the cocktail.189  
Highly-Regarded Alternatives:  
While Lillet Blanc is the standard, the original ingredient in the cocktail was Kina Lillet, which had a more pronounced quinine bitterness. Kina Lillet is no longer produced, but several other quinquinas (quinine-flavoured aromatised wines) can be used to create a more historically accurate and arguably more complex version of the drink.

* **Cocchi Americano Bianco:** This Italian aperitivo is often used as a substitute for Kina Lillet. It has a more pronounced gentian bitterness than Lillet Blanc and creates a more bracing and complex cocktail.189  
* **Tempus Fugit Kina L'Aéro d'Or:** This is a modern recreation of a historical quinquina. It is the most bitter of the options and is recommended for creating the most delicious and technically accurate version of the Corpse Reviver \#2.189

#### **Absinthe: The Aromatic Rinse**

A rinse of absinthe is what gives the cocktail its distinctive aromatic lift. Only a small amount is needed, so any high-quality, anise-forward absinthe will work perfectly.189 Brands like  
**Pernod Absinthe** or **La Fée Absinthe Parisienne** are excellent and widely available choices in the UK.

### **Cosmopolitan**

An icon of the 1990s cocktail renaissance, the Cosmopolitan is a sophisticated and refreshing drink that, when made correctly, is a perfectly balanced combination of citrus vodka, orange liqueur, fresh lime juice, and cranberry juice. The key to a great Cosmo is using high-quality ingredients and achieving the correct balance of sweet and tart.

#### **Vodka Citron: The Citrus Base**

The recipe calls for a citron vodka, which provides the primary citrus character of the drink.  
1\. The Original Standard: Absolut Citron  
Absolut Citron is the vodka that was used in the version of the Cosmopolitan that became globally famous.190 Launched in 1988, its bright, clean lemon flavour became the benchmark for the cocktail. For the authentic 1990s-style Cosmo, Absolut Citron is the definitive choice.191 It is available in all major UK supermarkets.  
2\. The Premium Alternative: Ketel One Citroen  
For a more premium take, Ketel One Citroen is an excellent choice. It is known for its exceptionally smooth character and natural, zesty lemon and lime flavour.  
3\. The DIY Option: Infused Vodka  
For the freshest possible flavour, infusing a high-quality neutral vodka (such as Ketel One or Stolichnaya) with fresh lemon peels for a few days will create a vibrant and superior citron vodka.190

#### **Cointreau: The Orange Liqueur**

As with the Corpse Reviver \#2, Cointreau is the specified and superior orange liqueur for a Cosmopolitan.190 Its clean, bright orange flavour and 40% ABV are essential for the drink's balance. Cheaper triple secs can make the drink overly sweet and syrupy.

### **Cuba Libre**

More than just a Rum and Coke, a true Cuba Libre is a specific drink with a history tied to the end of the Spanish-American War in Cuba around 1900\. The name, meaning "Free Cuba," was a celebratory toast. The crucial, non-negotiable ingredient that elevates it from a simple mixed drink to a cocktail is the addition of fresh lime juice, which cuts through the sweetness of the cola and complements the rum.

#### **White Rum: The Spirit of Cuba**

The cocktail's origins call for a light, Cuban-style white rum. This style is known for being clean, crisp, and smooth.  
1\. The Definitive Choice: Havana Club 3 Años  
As Cuba's flagship rum, Havana Club 3 Años is the most authentic choice for a Cuba Libre. It is aged for three years and then filtered, which gives it a light colour but retains a surprising amount of flavour, with notes of vanilla, pear, and a hint of oak. This complexity makes for a far superior Cuba Libre than one made with a completely unaged white rum. It is widely available in UK supermarkets.163  
2\. The Global Standard: Bacardi Superior Rum (Carta Blanca)  
While Bacardi is no longer produced in Cuba, its origins are Cuban, and its light, smooth profile is in the Cuban style. It is the world's best-selling rum and will make a perfectly clean and refreshing Cuba Libre. It is available everywhere.94

### **Daiquiri**

The Daiquiri is one of the most fundamental and elegant cocktails ever created. A perfect trinity of rum, lime, and sugar, it is the ultimate test of a bartender's skill and the quality of their ingredients. The authentic Cuban Daiquiri is shaken with ice and served straight up in a chilled coupe glass, not frozen and blended. Its success lies in achieving the perfect balance between the rum's character, the lime's acidity, and the sugar's sweetness.

#### **White Cuban Ron: The Heart of the Drink**

The recipe specifies a White Cuban Ron (rum). This style is light, clean, and crisp, but good examples that have been lightly aged and filtered will also have subtle notes of vanilla, fruit, and spice that add essential complexity.  
1\. The Authentic Choice: Havana Club 3 Años  
Havana Club 3 Años is widely regarded as the perfect rum for an authentic Cuban Daiquiri.162 Its three years of ageing provide a depth of flavour—vanilla, oak, and fruit—that unaged white rums lack, while its light body keeps the drink crisp and refreshing. It is the go-to rum for cocktail lovers seeking the true taste of Cuba.162  
2\. The Alternative Cuban: Ron Santiago de Cuba Carta Blanca  
Another excellent Cuban rum, Ron Santiago de Cuba is known for its smooth and flavourful profile. The Carta Blanca is a superb choice for a Daiquiri, offering a slightly different but equally authentic Cuban character. It is available from specialist UK retailers.192  
3\. The Non-Cuban Bartender's Choice: Plantation 3 Stars White Rum  
While not Cuban, this blend of rums from Barbados, Jamaica, and Trinidad is a favourite among bartenders for its exceptional quality and flavour. It has more character and a touch more funk than many Cuban-style rums, which creates a delicious and complex Daiquiri.

### **Dark ‘N’ Stormy**

The Dark ‘N’ Stormy is a masterclass in deceptive simplicity. Hailing from Bermuda, its identity is fiercely protected, standing as one of the few cocktails with a registered trademark.1 This legal status dictates that an official Dark ‘N’ Stormy must be made with a specific rum. However, this very restriction places an even greater emphasis on the second ingredient, the ginger beer, which becomes the primary vehicle for the mixologist's expression. The success of this two-ingredient highball rests entirely on the quality and character of its components and their interaction.

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Goslings Rum**

##### **The Standard**

To be legally named a Dark ‘n’ Stormy, the cocktail must be made with **Goslings Black Seal Rum**.1 This is not a matter of preference but of trademark law, a fact that Goslings has defended actively.2 The rum itself is a dark, full-bodied spirit from Bermuda, characterized by rich notes of molasses, caramel, and a subtle spice profile.3 This flavour profile is the benchmark for the drink; it is the deep, dark "storm cloud" that floats atop the ginger beer, providing a sweet and robust counterpoint to the mixer's spice.5 Its use is non-negotiable for an authentic rendition of the cocktail.

##### **Highly-Regarded Alternatives**

For a "Dark and Stormy-style" drink, where the name is not being used commercially, the mixology community often experiments with other dark or black rums to achieve different flavour profiles.

* **Recommendation 1: The Kraken Black Spiced Rum.** Frequently cited as a popular and flavourful alternative, The Kraken offers a bolder, more pronounced spice character than Goslings.6 Its notes of cinnamon, clove, and vanilla create a more intensely spiced version of the drink.  
* **Recommendation 2: Cruzan Black Strap Rum.** Favoured by rum enthusiasts for a more extreme interpretation, Cruzan Black Strap has a powerful, almost smoky molasses flavour that is significantly less sweet than Goslings.2 It produces a drier, more intense cocktail with a profound depth of flavour.  
* **Recommendation 3: Plantation O.F.T.D. (Old Fashioned Traditional Dark).** A high-proof (69% ABV) blend of rums from Jamaica, Guyana, and Barbados, O.F.T.D. is a choice for those seeking a powerful, complex, and flavour-packed drink.2 Its higher strength and funky character create a formidable cocktail that is not for the faint of heart.

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Ginger Beer**

##### **The Critical Choice**

While the rum is fixed by trademark, the choice of ginger beer is an open field, making it the most critical decision in crafting a superior Dark ‘N’ Stormy. Enthusiast and professional debate centres almost exclusively on this ingredient, as its level of spice, sweetness, and carbonation dictates the final character of the drink.2 The quality of the ginger beer can elevate the cocktail from a simple rum and mixer to a complex and invigorating experience. The key is to select a brand with enough ginger "bite" to stand up to the rich, sweet rum.3

##### **Top Recommendation (Spicy & Complex): Fever-Tree Premium Ginger Beer**

Across a wide range of sources, **Fever-Tree Premium Ginger Beer** is the most frequently and enthusiastically recommended option.1 It is lauded for its assertive, spicy ginger flavour and robust carbonation, which provide a perfect, fiery counterpoint to the sweetness of the Goslings rum. Unlike milder ginger ales, Fever-Tree has the backbone necessary to prevent the drink from becoming cloying.3 It is widely available in major UK supermarkets, including Morrisons and Tesco, making it both a high-quality and accessible choice.8

##### **Second Recommendation (Botanical & Fiery): Fentiman's Botanically Brewed Ginger Beer**

A close second in popularity and quality, **Fentiman's Ginger Beer** is another top-tier choice for a powerful Dark ‘N’ Stormy.3 It is produced using a botanical brewing process, resulting in a complex, fermented flavour profile with a distinct and authentic fiery kick from Chinese ginger root.10 It is a sophisticated choice that adds layers of botanical complexity to the drink. Fentiman's is readily available in UK supermarkets such as Sainsbury's.11

##### **Alternative Consideration (The Authentic Original): Barritt's Ginger Beer**

For the purist, **Barritt's Ginger Beer** is worth seeking out. According to Bermudian history, Barritt's was the original ginger beer paired with Goslings rum before Goslings began producing their own mixer.7 Its flavour profile is noted as being slightly sweeter and having a lighter ginger flavour compared to Fever-Tree or Fentiman's.10 While less common in UK supermarkets, it represents the most traditional expression of the cocktail.

##### **Note on Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer**

Goslings produces its own branded ginger beer, **Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer**, specifically for this cocktail.5 While it is designed to be a perfect partner, many enthusiasts and reviewers find it to be too sweet and lacking the spicy kick of the top-recommended brands, which can result in a less balanced drink.6

| Ingredient | Status | Top Recommendation | Second Recommendation | Alternative Consideration |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Rum** | Official | Goslings Black Seal Rum | N/A | The Kraken Black Spiced Rum |
| **Ginger Beer** | Variable | Fever-Tree Premium Ginger Beer | Fentiman's Ginger Beer | Barritt's Ginger Beer |

### **Don's Special Daiquiri**

This cocktail is a classic from the Tiki canon, attributed to the legendary Don the Beachcomber.13 It serves as a perfect illustration of the core Tiki principle of creating complexity through the layering of multiple, distinct ingredients. The use of two different rum styles (Jamaican and Cuban) and two different sweeteners (passion fruit and honey) is a deliberate architectural choice. This is not merely a daiquiri; it is an exercise in balancing the "funk" of Jamaican pot-still rum with the clean, dry base of a Cuban-style rum, while simultaneously harmonizing the tart, tropical notes of passion fruit with the floral depth of honey.

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Gold Jamaican Rum**

##### **Defining the Category**

The term "Gold Jamaican Rum" is not a formally regulated category but generally refers to a moderately aged rum, produced using either pot stills or a blend of pot and column stills. Its defining characteristic is the presence of "funk"—a flavour profile rich in esters that manifest as notes of overripe banana, tropical fruits, and a distinctive savoury quality.14 This element provides the cocktail with its complex, fruity backbone.

##### **Top Recommendation (Balanced Funk): Appleton Estate Signature**

The most consistently recommended bottle for this category is **Appleton Estate Signature**. It is praised for striking an ideal balance between classic Jamaican funk and approachability, making it a versatile and reliable choice for mixing.14 Its flavour profile includes notes of brown sugar, dried apricot, and orange peel, which provide the necessary character for the daiquiri without overpowering the other delicate ingredients.16 Appleton Estate Signature is widely available in the UK from specialist retailers and some larger supermarkets.19

##### **Second Recommendation (Pot-Still Forward): Rum-Bar Gold**

For those wishing to amplify the characteristic Jamaican funk, **Rum-Bar Gold** from the Worthy Park Estate is an excellent choice.14 It is a pure, unadulterated pot-still rum with pronounced notes of banana and tropical fruit.16 This rum delivers a more intense and ester-forward experience, making the drink distinctly more "Tiki" in character. It is available in the UK through specialist online retailers.22

##### **Alternative Consideration (High-Proof Funk): Smith & Cross Traditional Jamaica Rum**

An iconic bottle among Tiki enthusiasts, **Smith & Cross** is an overproof rum bottled at 57% ABV.15 It is a blend of two different pot-still rums and is packed with intense, funky flavours. Using Smith & Cross will create a much bolder, more potent, and complex version of the Don's Special Daiquiri. It should be considered an "advanced" option for those who appreciate a high-ester, high-proof flavour profile.16 It is available from specialist UK retailers.25

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Cuban Rum**

##### **Defining the Style**

Cuban rum, and its close relatives often referred to as "Spanish-style" rums, provides the cocktail's clean and refreshing base. This style is typically produced using column stills, resulting in a lighter-bodied, crisper, and drier spirit compared to its Jamaican counterparts.14 It is lightly aged to add subtle notes of vanilla and spice without imparting heavy wood influence.

##### **Top Recommendation (The Authentic Choice): Havana Club Añejo 3 Años**

Universally regarded as the quintessential rum for a classic Daiquiri, **Havana Club Añejo 3 Años** is the ideal choice for this cocktail.17 Its flavour profile, featuring notes of vanilla, pear, banana, and a hint of toasted oak, provides the perfect clean canvas upon which the other, more assertive flavours can be layered.31 Its authenticity and quality make it the top recommendation. Havana Club 3 Años is widely available in UK supermarkets and specialist stores.32

##### **Second Recommendation (Widely Available Substitute): Plantation 3 Stars**

A highly respected alternative among bartenders is **Plantation 3 Stars**. This is a blend of unaged and lightly aged rums from three different Caribbean islands: Barbados (for richness), Trinidad (for finesse), and Jamaica (for a touch of funk).31 The resulting spirit is crisp, clean, and well-balanced, effectively mimicking the light, refreshing profile required for the cocktail and making it an excellent and readily available substitute.17

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Passion Fruit Syrup**

##### **Syrup vs. Purée**

The quality of the passion fruit syrup is crucial for achieving the correct balance of tartness and tropical fruit flavour. A key distinction exists between standard syrups, which can be overly sweet and artificial, and purée-infused syrups, which offer a more authentic fruit body, texture, and acidity. For a classic Tiki drink, a purée-based syrup with a high fruit content is preferable, as it delivers a more vibrant and less confectioned flavour.35

##### **Top Recommendation (Bartender's Choice): Bristol Syrup Co. Passionfruit Syrup**

Produced in the UK and held in high regard by the bar industry, **Bristol Syrup Co. Passionfruit Syrup** is an excellent choice. It is praised for its bold, ripe passion fruit flavour and a well-judged balance of sweetness and acidity, ensuring it enhances rather than dominates the cocktail.36 It is available from specialist UK online retailers such as The Whisky Exchange.37

##### **Second Recommendation (High Fruit Content): Reàl Passion Fruit Purée Infused Syrup**

Another high-quality option, **Reàl Passion Fruit Purée Infused Syrup** is made with a high percentage of Vietnamese passion fruit purée, giving it an excellent texture and authentic tropical flavour.35 Its convenient squeezy bottle format also makes it a practical choice for the home bar. It can be sourced from various UK online spirits retailers.38

##### **Alternative Consideration (Widely Available): Monin Passion Fruit Syrup**

**Monin Passion Fruit Syrup** is a global standard and is the most widely available option in the UK, found in supermarkets and online.40 While reliable and consistent, it is generally considered to be sweeter and to have a less complex flavour profile than the purée-based alternatives.

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Honey Syrup**

##### **The DIY Standard**

For superior flavour, freshness, and control over sweetness, it is strongly recommended to make honey syrup at home. Commercial honey syrups can contain preservatives or have a muted flavour. The ideal ratio, as recommended by industry experts, is 3 parts honey to 1 part water by weight.44 This ratio ensures the syrup is fluid enough to mix easily while retaining the honey's natural viscosity and flavour intensity. It is critical to use only gentle heat (below  
36∘C) when dissolving the honey to avoid destroying its delicate floral and aromatic compounds.44 Using a raw, local wildflower honey will add the most character to the final drink.

##### **Commercial Option**

For those who prioritize convenience, **Giffard Miel (Honey) Syrup** is a reliable pre-made option from a reputable French producer known for high-quality syrups.46

| Ingredient | Top Recommendation | Second Recommendation | Alternative Consideration |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Gold Jamaican Rum** | Appleton Estate Signature | Rum-Bar Gold | Smith & Cross |
| **Cuban Rum** | Havana Club Añejo 3 Años | Plantation 3 Stars | N/A |
| **Passion Fruit Syrup** | Bristol Syrup Co. Passionfruit Syrup | Reàl Passion Fruit Purée Infused Syrup | Monin Passion Fruit Syrup |
| **Honey Syrup** | Homemade (3:1 Ratio) | Giffard Miel (Honey) Syrup | N/A |

### **Dry Martini**

The Dry Martini stands as the undisputed pinnacle of cocktail sophistication. Its preparation is a ritual, and its composition—a simple duet of gin and vermouth—is a true test of a bartender's skill and the quality of their ingredients. The beauty of the Martini lies in the elegant interplay between the sharp, botanical character of a juniper-forward gin and the subtle, herbal complexity of a quality dry vermouth. Every element, from the choice of spirit to the temperature of the glass, is critical.

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Gin**

##### **The Profile**

There is a strong consensus among professionals and enthusiasts that the ideal gin for a classic Dry Martini is a juniper-forward London Dry style.47 The gin must have a pronounced juniper backbone to be considered a true "gin martini." Furthermore, a slightly higher proof, typically in the range of  
44% to 50% ABV, is preferred. This additional strength allows the gin to maintain its character and not be overshadowed by the vermouth, particularly in "wetter" Martinis that use a more generous measure of the fortified wine.47

##### **Top Recommendation (The Benchmark): Beefeater London Dry Gin**

**Beefeater London Dry** is frequently cited as a paradigm of the London Dry style and an exceptional choice for a Martini.48 It is lauded for its high quality, affordability, and perfectly balanced botanical profile, which features a robust juniper core supported by bright citrus and subtle spice notes.49 Its clean, crisp character makes for a classic, no-nonsense Martini. Beefeater is widely available in all major UK supermarkets.

##### **Second Recommendation (The Craft Choice): Sipsmith London Dry Gin**

For a more premium, craft-oriented Martini, **Sipsmith London Dry Gin** is a superb option. It is a classic London Dry style gin that is highly praised for its impeccable balance of bright citrus notes and assertive juniper.48 Bartenders particularly recommend it for those who prefer a very dry Martini, as its refined profile allows for a minimalist approach where the quality of the gin can truly shine.50 Sipsmith is available in most UK supermarkets and specialist retailers.

##### **Alternative Consideration (The Earthy Alternative): Plymouth Gin**

While not a London Dry, **Plymouth Gin** is a historic style in its own right and offers a fantastic alternative for a Martini. Compared to London Dry, Plymouth has a softer juniper profile and a more pronounced earthy and citrus-forward character.47 This makes for a slightly less bracing, smoother Martini. It is the traditional choice for cocktails like the Gibson, where its profile allows the savoury garnish to take centre stage.47

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Dry Vermouth**

##### **The Supporting Star**

The role of dry vermouth in a Martini is often misunderstood but is absolutely critical. It is not merely an afterthought to be waved in the general direction of the glass; it is a vital component that adds aromatic complexity, herbal depth, and a silky texture to the finished drink. The choice of vermouth should complement the chosen gin.

##### **Top Recommendation (The Universal Standard): Dolin Dry Vermouth de Chambéry**

Across the board, **Dolin Dry Vermouth de Chambéry** is regarded as the "default" or house-pour vermouth for a high-quality, classic Martini.51 Hailing from the Chambéry region of France, it is known for its light, delicate, and floral profile. It has a refined character that beautifully complements a classic London Dry gin without overpowering its botanicals, making it the perfect supporting actor.51 It is available from specialist retailers and larger supermarkets like Waitrose.

##### **Second Recommendation (The Fuller-Bodied Classic): Noilly Prat Original Dry**

For a Martini with a more robust and traditional character, **Noilly Prat Original Dry** is the classic choice.52 This Marseilles-style vermouth is aged outdoors in oak casks, which imparts a slightly oxidized, fuller-bodied, and spicier character compared to Dolin. It creates a more complex and assertive Martini, pairing well with higher-proof gins. It is widely available in UK supermarkets.

##### **Alternative Consideration (The Savory Option): Mancino Secco Vermouth**

An Italian dry vermouth that has gained favour in modern craft cocktail bars, **Mancino Secco** offers a distinctly more herbaceous and savory profile.51 Aromatized with botanicals like sage, marjoram, and oregano, it provides a nutty, aromatic complexity that is less floral than its French counterparts. This makes it an outstanding choice for a Dirty Martini, as its savory notes harmonize perfectly with olive brine, or for anyone seeking a less traditional, more herbal cocktail.51

### **Espresso Martini**

The Espresso Martini is a titan of the modern classic cocktail era, a drink that expertly bridges the gap between a pre-dinner aperitif and a post-dinner digestif. Invented in the 1980s, its success lies in the careful balancing of three key elements: the clean, neutral kick of vodka; the rich, aromatic bitterness of freshly brewed espresso; and the complex, roasted sweetness of a coffee liqueur. The quality of each component is paramount to achieving the cocktail's signature creamy foam and harmonious flavour profile.

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Vodka**

##### **The Profile**

The ideal vodka for an Espresso Martini should be smooth, clean, and possess a neutral or slightly creamy character.54 A harsh or impure vodka will create a noticeable alcoholic burn that clashes with the delicate coffee flavours. The goal is to provide a solid alcoholic base that complements the espresso and liqueur without introducing unwanted flavours or a sharp aftertaste.

##### **Top Recommendation (The Bartender's Choice): Ketel One Vodka**

**Ketel One** is a Dutch wheat vodka that is partially distilled in copper pot stills, a process that imparts a uniquely crisp and smooth texture.54 It is frequently recommended for Espresso Martinis because its clean, refined profile allows the rich coffee and liqueur notes to be the stars of the show.55 Its subtle citrus and peppery spice notes add a layer of complexity without being intrusive. Ketel One is widely available in UK supermarkets and specialist stores.

##### **Second Recommendation (The Premium Standard): Grey Goose Vodka**

For a more luxurious and elegant Espresso Martini, **Grey Goose** is an excellent choice. This premium French wheat vodka is renowned for its exceptionally soft, smooth, and rounded profile.54 It creates a cocktail with a silky mouthfeel and a refined finish, enhancing the smoothness of the espresso. Grey Goose is a staple in high-end bars and is readily available across the UK.56

##### **Alternative Consideration (The Rye Option): Belvedere Vodka**

**Belvedere** is a Polish rye vodka that offers a different character. It is noted for its full, silky texture and subtle notes of vanilla and almond.54 This creamy profile pairs beautifully with the espresso, adding a layer of richness and complexity to the cocktail. For those who enjoy a vodka with a bit more character and a velvety mouthfeel, Belvedere is a superb alternative.56

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Kahlúa**

##### **The Standard**

The original and most widely recognized coffee liqueur for this cocktail is **Kahlúa**.57 Made with a rum base and Arabica coffee, it has a distinctly sweet profile with strong notes of vanilla and caramel. While it is the classic choice and produces a perfectly acceptable Espresso Martini, many modern bartenders find it can make the drink overly sweet.

##### **Highly-Regarded Alternatives**

The modern craft cocktail movement has produced several coffee liqueurs that are now preferred by many professionals for their more authentic and less saccharine coffee flavour.

* **Top Recommendation (The Modern Classic): Mr. Black Cold Brew Coffee Liqueur.** This Australian liqueur has become a firm favourite in the global bar community.58 It is significantly less sweet than Kahlúa and has a much more robust and authentic cold-brew coffee flavour. Using Mr. Black results in a more coffee-forward, balanced, and sophisticated Espresso Martini.59 It is available from specialist UK retailers.  
* **Second Recommendation (The Italian Espresso): Borghetti di Vero Caffe Espresso Liqueur.** Produced by the makers of Fernet-Branca, **Borghetti** is another bartender favourite.57 It is praised for tasting like true, strong Italian espresso rather than a sweetened coffee flavouring. Its punchy, authentic character and lower sweetness make it an excellent choice for a bold, espresso-forward cocktail.57  
* **Alternative Consideration (The Complex Craft): St. George NOLA Coffee Liqueur.** For a more unconventional and complex drink, this liqueur from California's St. George Spirits is a fantastic option. Inspired by New Orleans-style coffee, it is made with Ethiopian coffee beans, French roasted chicory root, and Madagascan vanilla.57 This creates a liqueur with earthy, nutty, and bittersweet chocolate notes, adding a unique depth of flavour to the cocktail.

### **Fernandito**

Known colloquially in its native Argentina as *Fernet con Coca*, the Fernandito is a highball of uncompromising character. It is a drink that is brutally simple in its construction but deeply complex and often divisive in its flavour. There is no nuance to hide behind; the cocktail is a direct confrontation between the intensely bitter, herbal, and mentholated profile of Fernet-Branca and the sweet, caramel-driven flavour of cola. For its adherents, it is the ultimate digestif and a cultural icon.60

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Fernet Branca**

##### **The Standard**

For an authentic Fernandito, the use of **Fernet-Branca** is non-negotiable.62 The entire identity of the drink is built around this specific Italian  
*amaro*. Created in 1845, its recipe is a closely guarded secret, said to contain 27 different herbs and spices, including myrrh, rhubarb, chamomile, cardamom, and saffron.64 The resulting flavour is intensely bitter, with powerful notes of menthol, licorice, and eucalyptus. It is this unique and assertive profile that the cola is tasked with taming. Fernet-Branca is widely available in the UK from specialist retailers and larger supermarkets.65

##### **Highly-Regarded Alternatives (For Exploration)**

While no other spirit can create a true Fernandito, it is worth noting other *fernet* style liqueurs for those who appreciate the category. These should be considered for creating different *amaro* and cola highballs, not for replicating the original.

* **Branca Menta:** A sibling product from the same producer, Branca Menta is a sweeter, more mint-forward version of Fernet-Branca, offering a less bitter and more approachable experience.69  
* **Luxardo Fernet:** This version is often described as being slightly drier and less mentholated than Fernet-Branca, with a different herbal complexity.64  
* **Other Amari:** For those who find Fernet-Branca too challenging, other Italian amari like Cynar (artichoke-based) or Amaro Montenegro (sweeter, orange-led profile) can be mixed with cola for a more palatable, though entirely different, drink.69

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Cola**

##### **The Partner in Crime**

The role of the cola in a Fernandito is critical: it must provide enough sweetness, dilution, and carbonation to balance the formidable bitterness of the Fernet. The choice of cola is not a minor detail, as different brands have varying levels of sweetness, spice, and citrus notes that will significantly impact the final drink.

##### **Top Recommendation (The Authentic Choice): Coca-Cola Classic**

Across all sources and by cultural tradition, **Coca-Cola Classic** is the undisputed and correct partner for Fernet-Branca in this cocktail.60 Its specific and iconic flavour profile—with its high level of sweetness, caramel notes, and subtle spice—is considered the perfect foil for the intense herbal bitterness of the Fernet. The synergy between these two specific brands is what defines the drink. Using other colas, particularly those with less sugar or different flavourings, will result in a significantly different and likely less balanced cocktail.

### **French 75**

The French 75 is a timeless celebratory cocktail, a perfect marriage of the botanical complexity of gin and the effervescent elegance of Champagne. Named after the French 75mm field gun from World War I, the drink is said to have a kick that feels like being shelled with one.72 Achieving the perfect French 75 is a matter of precise balance; the gin, lemon, sugar, and sparkling wine must work in harmony to create a drink that is crisp, refreshing, and sophisticated, without being overly sweet or sour.

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Gin**

##### **The Profile**

The traditional choice for a French 75 is a classic London Dry gin, whose juniper backbone provides a solid foundation for the cocktail.73 However, given the drink's prominent citrus notes from the lemon juice, many modern bartenders advocate for gins that also have a strong citrus character. A gin that is too subtle will be lost behind the lemon and Champagne, so a spirit with a confident flavour profile is essential.73

##### **Top Recommendation (The Classic): Tanqueray London Dry Gin**

**Tanqueray London Dry Gin** is an excellent and classic choice for a French 75\. Its bold, juniper-forward profile, supported by notes of coriander, angelica, and liquorice, is robust enough to stand up to the other powerful ingredients in the drink.72 It creates a traditional, well-structured, and perfectly balanced version of the cocktail. Tanqueray is a staple of bars worldwide and is available in all major UK retailers.

##### **Second Recommendation (The Citrus-Forward): Beefeater London Dry Gin**

**Beefeater London Dry Gin** is another highly recommended option, particularly praised for its clean, crisp profile and prominent notes of Seville orange and lemon peel.73 This bright citrus character harmonizes beautifully with the fresh lemon juice in the recipe, creating a vibrant and refreshing French 75\. Its quality and affordability make it an outstanding choice for any home bar.49

##### **Alternative Consideration (The Modern Botanical): The Botanist Islay Dry Gin**

For a more contemporary and complex take on the cocktail, **The Botanist** is a superb choice. This Scottish gin features 22 hand-foraged botanicals from the island of Islay, resulting in a highly aromatic and nuanced spirit with distinct floral, herbal, and citrus notes.73 Using The Botanist will produce a French 75 with greater depth and a more complex botanical character, appealing to those with a modern palate.49

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Champagne**

##### **Champagne vs. Sparkling Wine**

While the cocktail's name implies the use of true Champagne, this is a point of debate among mixologists. Purists argue that the unique yeasty, brioche notes of Champagne are essential to the classic flavour profile.77 However, many pragmatists contend that using an expensive bottle of Champagne in a cocktail is wasteful, and that a high-quality, dry sparkling wine made in the same traditional method—such as a Crémant—is a more sensible and equally delicious choice.79 An expert approach acknowledges both viewpoints, providing options for both the purist and the pragmatist. The cardinal rule, regardless of origin, is to use a dry (  
*Brut*) sparkling wine to avoid an overly sweet drink.77

##### **Top Recommendation (Champagne): Non-Vintage Brut Champagne**

For the most authentic and luxurious French 75, a good quality Non-Vintage (NV) Brut Champagne is the ideal choice. Brands like **Veuve Clicquot Yellow Label**, **Taittinger La Française**, or **Moët & Chandon Brut Impérial** are excellent options.75 They offer consistent quality, fine and persistent bubbles, and the classic flavour profile of green apple, citrus, and toasted brioche that defines the drink.

##### **Second Recommendation (Alternative French Sparkling): Crémant de Bourgogne**

For a high-quality yet more affordable option, a **Crémant de Bourgogne** is an outstanding choice. Produced in Burgundy using the same traditional method as Champagne, it offers a similar crisp, dry profile with fine bubbles and notes of citrus and white flowers.79 It provides the necessary elegance and structure for the cocktail without the premium price tag of Champagne.

##### **Alternative Considerations (Other Sparkling Wines)**

Other dry sparkling wines can be used, but they will alter the cocktail's character. A Spanish **Cava** will often be more earthy and mineral-driven, while an Italian **Prosecco** (typically made using a different method) will be fruitier and lighter-bodied.79 These are perfectly acceptable for a sparkling gin cocktail, but will move the drink further away from the classic French 75 profile.

### **French Connection**

The French Connection is a simple, sophisticated, and spirit-forward after-dinner drink. As a member of the "Godfather" family of cocktails (spirit plus amaretto), its beauty lies in its simplicity, combining the rich, fruity, and oaky notes of Cognac with the sweet, nutty flavour of amaretto liqueur. The quality of the two ingredients is paramount, as there is nothing else in the glass to mask imperfections.

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Cognac**

##### **The Profile**

The Cognac provides the cocktail's soul and structure. A Very Superior Old Pale (VSOP) grade Cognac is generally recommended for this drink. A VSOP is aged for a minimum of four years, giving it a good balance of youthful fruitiness and the deeper notes of oak, spice, and vanilla from barrel aging.82 This level of maturity provides the necessary depth to stand up to the sweetness of the amaretto without being overwhelmingly oaky, as a more expensive XO might be.

##### **Top Recommendation (The Classic): Hennessy V.S.O.P Privilège**

**Hennessy V.S.O.P** is a classic and reliable choice, frequently recommended for mixing in cocktails.82 It has a well-balanced profile with notes of vanilla, clove, cinnamon, and candied fruit, supported by a gentle oakiness. Its smooth and harmonious character makes it an ideal partner for amaretto, creating a rich and seamless French Connection. Hennessy is widely available in the UK.

##### **Second Recommendation (The Versatile): Rémy Martin V.S.O.P**

Another of the "big four" Cognac houses, **Rémy Martin V.S.O.P** is also an excellent and widely available option.82 It is known for its notes of baked apple, ripe apricot, and a hint of licorice. It is a smooth and versatile Cognac that performs exceptionally well in cocktails, providing a slightly fruitier profile than the Hennessy.

##### **Alternative Consideration (The Value Choice): Courvoisier V.S.O.P**

**Courvoisier V.S.O.P** is another high-quality and widely available choice that often represents good value.85 It is noted for its floral and fruity notes, with flavours of peach, toasted almond, and jasmine, making it a slightly lighter but still complex option for the French Connection.

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Amaretto**

##### **The Profile**

Amaretto is an Italian liqueur that provides the cocktail's characteristic sweet, nutty flavour. While often described as almond-flavoured, high-quality amaretto is traditionally made from apricot kernels, which impart a distinct marzipan-like character.86 The best amarettos for a French Connection are those that have a rich, authentic nuttiness and are not overly sweet, allowing the complex flavours of the Cognac to shine through.

##### **Top Recommendation (The Benchmark): Disaronno Originale**

**Disaronno Originale** is the world's best-known and best-selling amaretto, and it is the classic choice for a French Connection.83 Its iconic flavour, derived from a secret recipe dating back to 1525, is a complex blend of apricot kernel oil, burnt sugar, and the essence of 17 herbs and fruits.88 Its rich, sweet, and unmistakable marzipan flavour is the benchmark for the cocktail. Disaronno is available in every UK supermarket.

##### **Second Recommendation (The Craft Choice): Lazzaroni Amaretto**

For a more artisanal option, **Lazzaroni Amaretto** is highly regarded by connoisseurs.86 Uniquely, its flavour is derived from an infusion of the famous Lazzaroni Amaretti di Saronno biscuits, which are made with apricot kernels. This process results in a liqueur with a delicate, authentic, and less intensely sweet profile compared to Disaronno, making it a sophisticated choice.89 It is available from specialist UK retailers.

##### **Alternative Consideration (The Bartender's Pick): Luxardo Amaretto di Saschira**

**Luxardo Amaretto** is another top-tier alternative, favoured by many bartenders.86 Like Disaronno, it is made from the essential oils of apricot pits, but it is often described as having a more fragrant, toasted almond character with a well-balanced sweetness. It is an excellent choice for creating a refined and flavourful cocktail.89

### **French Martini**

Despite its name, the French Martini is not a true martini but rather a fruity, vodka-based cocktail that emerged from the cocktail renaissance of the 1980s and 1990s. Its three ingredients—vodka, raspberry liqueur, and pineapple juice—create a drink that is sweet, vibrant, and exceptionally smooth. The name comes from the use of a French raspberry liqueur, typically Chambord.90

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Vodka**

##### **The Profile**

As the backbone of the drink, the vodka should be of high quality to ensure a clean and smooth base. While vodka is often chosen for its neutrality, a spirit with a subtle character—be it creamy, crisp, or slightly fruity—can enhance the cocktail's overall texture and flavour. A harsh, lower-quality vodka will be noticeable and detract from the drink's elegant profile.90

##### **Top Recommendation (The Premium French): Grey Goose Vodka**

To lean into the "French" theme of the cocktail, **Grey Goose** is the perfect choice.90 This premium French wheat vodka is known for its exceptionally smooth, soft, and clean profile. Its refined character allows the fruit flavours of the raspberry liqueur and pineapple juice to shine while providing a silky, luxurious mouthfeel.93 It is widely available in the UK.

##### **Second Recommendation (The Crisp Standard): Ketel One Vodka**

**Ketel One** is a high-quality Dutch vodka that is consistently recommended for mixing.55 Its crisp, clean taste and smooth finish make it an excellent base for the French Martini, providing alcoholic structure without interfering with the delicate fruit flavours. It is a versatile workhorse vodka for any home bar and is readily available in UK supermarkets.

##### **Alternative Consideration (The Neutral Value): Smirnoff No. 21 Vodka**

For a reliable and budget-friendly option, **Smirnoff No. 21** is a solid choice. It is praised for its neutrality, which is exactly what is required in a cocktail where the other ingredients are meant to be the primary flavours.92 It provides a clean alcoholic base without any distinctive character, allowing the Chambord and pineapple to take centre stage.

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Raspberry Liqueur**

##### **The Profile**

This ingredient is the heart of the French Martini and is what gives the cocktail its name and its signature flavour and colour. The classic choice is a French black raspberry liqueur, which offers a rich, deep berry flavour that is both sweet and slightly tart.

##### **Top Recommendation (The Original): Chambord Black Raspberry Liqueur**

**Chambord** is the original and definitive raspberry liqueur for a French Martini.90 Produced in the Loire Valley, it is an infusion of raspberries and blackberries in French spirits, blended with XO Cognac, Madagascan vanilla, and other herbs and spices.95 This complex production process results in a liqueur with a rich, velvety texture and a deep, luxurious berry flavour that is unmatched for this specific cocktail. Chambord is widely available in UK supermarkets and specialist retailers in various bottle sizes.96

##### **Highly-Regarded Alternatives**

While Chambord is the classic, other high-quality raspberry or berry liqueurs can be used.

* **St. George Raspberry Liqueur:** A premium craft option from the US, this liqueur is praised for being less sweet and having a more intense, jammy, and authentic raspberry flavour than Chambord.100 It creates a more fruit-forward and less sweet French Martini.  
* **Giffard Crème de Framboise:** From the respected French syrup and liqueur producer Giffard, this is a high-quality raspberry liqueur that offers a pure, vibrant fruit flavour.  
* **Crème de Mûre (Blackberry Liqueur):** For a slight variation, a blackberry liqueur like **Giffard Crème de Mûre** can be substituted, which will give the drink a deeper, jammier, and slightly tarter berry profile.

### **Garibaldi**

The Garibaldi is a classic Italian *aperitivo* that celebrates simplicity. Named after Giuseppe Garibaldi, a key figure in the unification of Italy, the drink itself unifies two iconic Italian ingredients: a bitter liqueur from the north (Campari from Milan) and the sweet juice of oranges from the south. At its best, it is a vibrant, refreshing, and perfectly balanced highball where the key is using the best possible orange juice to complement the assertive bitterness of the Campari.101

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Bitter Campari**

##### **The Standard**

The Garibaldi is fundamentally a Campari and orange juice. **Campari** is the essential, non-negotiable spirit for this drink.103 Its iconic, vibrant red hue and complex flavour profile—a secret recipe of herbs and fruit—is intensely bitter with notes of grapefruit, rhubarb, and spice. This assertive bitterness is what the sweet, fresh orange juice is meant to balance.104 Any substitute would create a different drink entirely. Campari is a staple in any bar and is available in every UK supermarket.

##### **Highly-Regarded Alternatives**

While not for a traditional Garibaldi, those who find Campari too intense can experiment with other Italian red bitters to create a similar style of drink.

* **Aperol:** The most common substitute, Aperol is lighter, sweeter, and less bitter than Campari, with more pronounced notes of orange and rhubarb.103 An "Aperol-Garibaldi" would be a much more approachable and less challenging drink.  
* **Amaro Santoni:** A modern, artisanal alternative from Florence, Amaro Santoni is a rhubarb-based amaro with floral and citrus notes, offering a different, more nuanced bitterness.105  
* **Non-Alcoholic Alternatives:** For a non-alcoholic version, products like **The Spirit of Milano** from Free Spirits are designed to replicate the bittersweet character of Campari.101

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Freshly Squeezed Orange Juice**

##### **The Critical Component**

The quality of the orange juice is the single most important factor in making an exceptional Garibaldi. It must be freshly squeezed.102 Carton juice, which is often pasteurized and from concentrate, lacks the brightness, sweetness, and aromatic oils necessary to stand up to the bitterness of Campari. The type of orange and the method of juicing also play a significant role.

##### **The "Fluffy" Juice Technique**

The world-renowned version of the Garibaldi served at Dante in New York City is famous for its "fluffy" orange juice.107 This texture is achieved by using a high-speed centrifugal juicer, which aerates the juice and creates a light, frothy texture. This aeration helps to soften the bitter edges of the Campari, creating a smoother, more integrated drink.101 While a centrifugal juicer is ideal, vigorously dry-shaking the juice in a cocktail shaker or even using a blender can help to incorporate air and improve the texture.101

##### **Orange Varieties**

While any good quality orange will work, experimenting with different varieties can add complexity.

* **Top Recommendation (For Balance): Valencia Oranges.** Valencia oranges are a classic choice for juicing, known for their perfect balance of sweetness and tartness and their high juice content.  
* **Alternative (For Colour and Flavour): Blood Oranges.** When in season, blood oranges are an excellent choice. Their juice is typically sweeter than that of standard oranges and has a distinct raspberry-like flavour that pairs beautifully with Campari. They also create a stunning visual gradient in the glass.102  
* **Advanced Riff (Multi-Citrus):** Some modern variations, like the one from bartender Luca Missaglia, use a blend of different citrus juices, such as blood orange and pink grapefruit, to create a more complex and layered drink.105

### **Gin Basil Smash**

A modern classic born in Hamburg in 2008, the Gin Basil Smash is a vibrant and aromatic cocktail that has quickly become a staple on bar menus worldwide.110 A simple variation on the Gin Sour, it takes the classic template of gin, lemon, and sugar and "smashes" it with a generous handful of fresh basil. The result is a stunningly green, herbaceous, and intensely refreshing drink where the peppery, anise-like notes of the basil are the star of the show.

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Gin**

##### **The Profile**

The Gin Basil Smash is a versatile cocktail that works well with a wide variety of gins. The primary consideration is how the gin's botanical profile will interact with the powerful flavour of the basil. A classic **London Dry gin** with a solid juniper backbone is a great starting point, as the piney notes of juniper are a natural partner for fresh herbs.112 Alternatively, gins with pronounced citrus or savoury, Mediterranean-style botanicals can also create exceptional versions of the drink.113

##### **Top Recommendation (The Classic): Hendrick's Gin**

**Hendrick's Gin** is frequently recommended and used in official recipes for the Gin Basil Smash.110 While not a traditional London Dry, its unique infusion of cucumber and rose provides a fresh, floral, and slightly vegetal character that complements the fresh basil perfectly. It creates a drink that is aromatic, refreshing, and exceptionally well-balanced. Hendrick's is widely available in all major UK retailers.

##### **Second Recommendation (The Mediterranean): Gin Mare**

**Gin Mare** is a Spanish gin with a distinctly Mediterranean botanical profile that includes basil, thyme, rosemary, and Arbequina olives.113 This makes it a natural and sophisticated choice for a Gin Basil Smash. The gin's inherent savoury and herbal notes amplify the basil in the cocktail, creating a complex and aromatic drink with a unique coastal character.111

##### **Alternative Consideration (The London Dry): Hayman's London Dry Gin**

For a more traditional, juniper-forward expression of the drink, **Hayman's London Dry Gin** is an excellent choice.111 Its classic, crisp botanical blend allows the basil to shine while providing a firm, gin-focused backbone. This is a great option for those who want the basil to be a clear feature against a traditional gin canvas.

### **Gin Fizz**

The Gin Fizz is a historic and iconic cocktail, a classic sour that is lengthened and lightened with the addition of soda water. It is a close relative of the Tom Collins, with the primary distinction often being that the Fizz is shaken (traditionally with egg white for texture) and served "straight up" in a smaller glass without ice, while the Collins is built over ice in a taller glass.116 The perfect Gin Fizz is a delicate balance of spirit, citrus, sweet, and effervescence, resulting in a drink that is both refreshing and invigorating.

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Gin**

##### **The Profile**

The gin in a Fizz should be flavourful enough to make its presence known against the sharp lemon and effervescent soda. A classic **London Dry gin** is the standard choice, offering a balanced profile of juniper and botanicals that works harmoniously in the drink.116 Overly floral or intensely spice-forward gins can sometimes overpower the cocktail's delicate balance, so a well-rounded gin is often preferred.116

##### **Top Recommendation (The All-Rounder): Beefeater London Dry Gin**

**Beefeater London Dry Gin** is an ideal choice for a Gin Fizz. Its profile is both juniper- and citrus-forward, providing a robust and classic gin character that is the perfect foundation for the cocktail.49 Its quality, balance, and affordability make it a go-to for this and many other classic gin drinks. It is available in all major UK supermarkets.

##### **Second Recommendation (The Traditional): An Old Tom Gin (e.g., Hayman's Old Tom)**

Historically, the Collins family of drinks, from which the Fizz evolved, was made with **Old Tom gin**, a slightly sweeter and less botanical-forward style of gin that was popular in the 18th and 19th centuries.118 Using an Old Tom gin like  
**Hayman's Old Tom** will create a Gin Fizz that is softer, rounder, and closer to the original historical expression of the drink. This is an excellent choice for those interested in exploring the cocktail's heritage.

##### **Alternative Consideration (The American Craft): Barr Hill Gin**

For a unique and modern twist, **Barr Hill Gin** from Vermont is a fascinating choice. It is distilled with raw honey, which gives it a distinct floral sweetness and a viscous texture.119 This profile works exceptionally well in a Fizz, with the honey notes complementing the lemon beautifully. It is particularly well-suited for the Ramos Gin Fizz, a famous New Orleans variation that includes cream and orange flower water.119

### **Grand Margarita**

The Grand Margarita, also known as a Cadillac Margarita, is an elevated version of the classic cocktail. The "Grand" signifies the use of premium ingredients, specifically a 100% agave tequila and, crucially, Grand Marnier as the orange liqueur. This substitution swaps the traditional, neutral-spirit-based triple sec for a richer, more complex, Cognac-based liqueur, resulting in a smoother, more luxurious, and more flavourful cocktail.

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Tequila 100% agave**

##### **The Profile**

For any high-quality Margarita, using a **100% blue agave tequila** is non-negotiable. Tequilas labelled simply as "tequila" (known as *mixtos*) can contain up to 49% other sugars and often result in a harsher, less flavourful drink with an unpleasant sweetness.120 For a Grand Margarita, a high-quality  
*blanco* (silver) or *reposado* tequila is appropriate. A *blanco* will provide a crisp, clean, and peppery agave-forward character, while a *reposado*, which is lightly aged in oak, will contribute softer notes of vanilla, caramel, and spice, complementing the oak notes from the Grand Marnier's Cognac base.121

##### **Top Recommendation (Reposado): Patrón Reposado**

**Patrón Reposado** is an excellent and widely recommended choice for a Grand Margarita.123 It is aged for at least two months in oak barrels, which imparts a pale golden hue and a smooth, balanced flavour with notes of fresh agave, oak, and a hint of citrus. This subtle aging complements the Cognac base of the Grand Marnier perfectly, creating a harmonious and sophisticated cocktail. Patrón is widely available in UK supermarkets and specialist retailers.124

##### **Second Recommendation (Blanco): Espolòn Blanco**

For those who prefer a brighter, more agave-forward Margarita, **Espolòn Blanco** is a superb and budget-friendly option.121 It is a highland tequila known for its smooth, balanced profile with notes of sweet agave, tropical fruit, and a hint of pepper. It creates a crisp and vibrant Grand Margarita where the fresh agave character shines through. It is available at retailers like Majestic Wine.123

##### **Alternative Consideration (Blanco): Olmeca Altos Plata**

Another fantastic and versatile *blanco* tequila, **Olmeca Altos Plata** is a favourite among bartenders for its quality and value.123 It has a slightly herbal and citrusy profile with a cooked agave sweetness that makes it an excellent base for all types of Margaritas. It is widely available in UK supermarkets.124

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Grand Marnier**

##### **The Standard**

The defining ingredient of this cocktail is **Grand Marnier Cordon Rouge**. This iconic French liqueur is a blend of bitter orange essence and premium Cognac.125 It is this Cognac base that distinguishes it from other orange liqueurs like Cointreau or triple sec, which are typically based on a neutral spirit. Grand Marnier adds not only orange flavour but also notes of vanilla, oak, and toffee, which lend the Margarita a unique richness, depth, and smoothness.126 It is widely available in all major UK retailers.125

##### **Highly-Regarded Alternatives**

While using Grand Marnier is what makes the cocktail "Grand," other high-quality orange liqueurs can be used to create an excellent Margarita.

* **Cointreau:** The other premium French orange liqueur, Cointreau is often considered the gold standard for a classic Margarita.121 It is a triple sec-style liqueur made with a blend of sweet and bitter orange peels. Compared to Grand Marnier, it is lighter, crisper, and has a more direct, pure orange flavour without the underlying notes of brandy.130  
* **Pierre Ferrand Dry Curaçao:** A highly-regarded craft option, this is a revival of a historic style of orange liqueur. It is also based on brandy and is flavoured with bitter Curaçao orange peels. It is drier and spicier than Grand Marnier, offering a more complex and less sweet profile.

### **Grasshopper**

The Grasshopper is a classic after-dinner or dessert cocktail that rose to popularity in the mid-20th century. It is a sweet, creamy, and mint-chocolate flavoured drink, named for its distinctive pastel green colour. The cocktail is a simple, equal-parts blend of green crème de menthe, white crème de cacao, and fresh cream, shaken together to create a light and frothy texture.

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Crème de Cacao (White)**

##### **The Profile**

White crème de cacao is a clear, chocolate-flavoured liqueur. It is essential to use the "white" (clear) version rather than the "dark" (brown) version to maintain the cocktail's signature green colour.132 The liqueur should provide a clear, sweet chocolate flavour, reminiscent of milk chocolate or chocolate fudge, to balance the sharp mint.

##### **Top Recommendation (The French Standard): Giffard Crème de Cacao Blanc**

From the respected French producer Giffard, **Giffard Crème de Cacao Blanc** is a high-quality choice. It is praised for its powerful aromas of dark chocolate and coffee, with a buttery finish that adds richness to the cocktail.133 It offers a complex and well-balanced chocolate flavour that elevates the drink beyond simple sweetness. It is available in the UK from specialist online retailers.134

##### **Second Recommendation (The Dutch Standard): De Kuyper Crème de Cacao White**

A widely available and reliable option from the Netherlands, **De Kuyper Crème de Cacao White** is a staple in many bars. It provides a solid, sweet chocolate flavour that works well in the Grasshopper and other classic creamy cocktails like the Brandy Alexander.

##### **Alternative Consideration (The Craft Choice): Tempus Fugit Crème de Cacao à la Vanille**

For a truly exceptional, historically accurate liqueur, **Tempus Fugit Crème de Cacao** is the top choice for connoisseurs. It is based on a 19th-century recipe, using cacao from Venezuela and vanilla from Mexico. It has a much richer, more complex, and less sweet profile than modern crème de cacaos, creating a truly sophisticated dessert cocktail. It is a specialist product available from select UK retailers.

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Crème de Menthe (Green)**

##### **The Profile**

Green crème de menthe is a sweet, peppermint-flavoured liqueur that is artificially coloured green. It provides both the mint flavour and the characteristic colour of the Grasshopper. A good crème de menthe should have a clean, refreshing peppermint taste without being overly artificial or medicinal.

##### **Top Recommendation (The French Standard): Giffard Crème de Menthe Verte**

**Giffard Crème de Menthe Verte** is an excellent choice, known for its great aromatic power and intense peppermint flavour that leaves a lasting freshness on the palate.135 Made from peppermint essential oils, it delivers a high-quality, authentic mint character. It is available in the UK from specialist retailers.136

##### **Second Recommendation (The Dutch Standard): De Kuyper Crème de Menthe Green**

A global bar standard, **De Kuyper Crème de Menthe Green** is a reliable and widely available option.138 It offers a cool, refreshing mint taste and the vibrant green colour necessary for a classic Grasshopper. It can be found in larger UK supermarkets and online.139

##### **Alternative Consideration (The British Craft): Bramley & Gage Crème de Menthe**

For a high-quality British option, Bramley & Gage produce an excellent crème de menthe. Made by distilling Black Mitcham peppermint, it offers a particularly fresh and authentic mint flavour.

### **Hanky Panky**

The Hanky Panky is a classic cocktail with a storied history, created in the early 1900s by Ada "Coley" Coleman, the celebrated head bartender at The American Bar in London's Savoy Hotel.141 The drink is a sophisticated variation on the Sweet Martini (or Martinez), combining gin and sweet vermouth. What makes it unique and gives it its memorable name is the addition of a few dashes of Fernet-Branca, which introduces a complex, bitter, and mentholated dimension to the cocktail.141

#### **Ingredient Analysis: London Dry Gin**

##### **The Profile**

The Hanky Panky requires a robust **London Dry Gin** to serve as its backbone. The gin's juniper and botanical notes must be assertive enough to stand up to the rich sweet vermouth and the powerful, herbaceous character of the Fernet-Branca. A classic, well-balanced London Dry is the ideal choice, providing the necessary structure for this spirit-forward cocktail.50

##### **Top Recommendation (The Classic): Tanqueray London Dry Gin**

**Tanqueray London Dry Gin** is an excellent choice for the Hanky Panky. Its high proof (47.3% ABV in some markets) and juniper-forward profile, with four key botanicals, provide the necessary power and classic gin character to balance the other ingredients.50 Its crispness cuts through the sweetness of the vermouth, allowing the complex notes of the Fernet to integrate harmoniously. Tanqueray is a globally recognized standard and is readily available.

##### **Second Recommendation (The All-Rounder): Beefeater London Dry Gin**

Another quintessential London Dry, **Beefeater** is a reliable and high-quality option.50 Its balanced profile, with bright citrus notes alongside the juniper, adds a layer of freshness to the cocktail. It is a versatile and affordable workhorse gin that performs exceptionally well in classic, stirred cocktails like the Hanky Panky.49

##### **Alternative Consideration (The Craft Choice): Sipsmith London Dry Gin**

For a more premium expression, **Sipsmith London Dry Gin** is a fantastic choice. As a pioneer of the modern craft gin movement in London, Sipsmith produces a classic, rich, and complex gin with a smooth finish.50 Its well-defined botanical character provides a sophisticated base for a truly elegant Hanky Panky. It is widely available in UK supermarkets.143

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Sweet Red Vermouth**

##### **The Profile**

Sweet red vermouth (vermouth rosso) provides the drink's rich body, sweetness, and a layer of spiced, fruity complexity. The choice of vermouth is critical; it should be rich enough to complement the gin but also have enough bitter and herbal notes of its own to bridge the gap to the Fernet-Branca. A classic Italian, Turin-style vermouth is the traditional choice.

##### **Top Recommendation (The Gold Standard): Carpano Antica Formula**

For a rich, bold, and complex Hanky Panky, **Carpano Antica Formula** is the gold standard among bartenders.144 This is a vanilla-forward, intensely flavoured vermouth di Torino with notes of saffron, bitter orange, and cocoa. Its power and complexity make it the perfect partner for the assertive flavours of gin and Fernet, creating a luxurious and deeply satisfying cocktail.144

##### **Second Recommendation (The Balanced Choice): Cocchi Vermouth di Torino**

**Cocchi Vermouth di Torino** is another exceptional Italian sweet vermouth that is slightly less vanilla-driven and more balanced than Carpano Antica.144 It has rich notes of cocoa, citrus, and rhubarb, with a pleasant bitterness that works beautifully in a Hanky Panky. It creates a sophisticated and well-integrated drink and is a favourite for Negronis and Manhattans as well.

##### **Alternative Consideration (The Lighter French): Dolin Vermouth Rouge**

For a slightly lighter and less sweet version of the cocktail, **Dolin Rouge** is a good option.144 This French sweet vermouth from Chambéry has a lighter body and a more floral, tree-fruit-forward profile compared to its Italian counterparts. It will create a more delicate Hanky Panky where the gin and Fernet are more prominent. It is available from UK retailers like Cotswold Port Co.145

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Fernet**

##### **The Standard**

The secret ingredient that defines the Hanky Panky is **Fernet-Branca**. Ada Coleman's original recipe calls for just two dashes of this potent Italian amaro.141 Its intense bitterness and mentholated, herbal character are meant to be an accent, a "hanky panky" that transforms the drink from a simple Sweet Martini into something far more complex and intriguing. While modern recipes often increase the amount to a bar spoon or more, Fernet-Branca remains the one and only choice for an authentic version of this cocktail.146

### **Hemingway Special**

The Hemingway Special, also known as the Papa Doble, is a variation on the classic Daiquiri created at the El Floridita bar in Havana, Cuba, for the writer Ernest Hemingway.149 As Hemingway was diabetic, he requested a Daiquiri with no sugar and double the rum. The resulting drink was intensely sour and potent. Over time, the recipe was refined by the bartenders at El Floridita to create a more balanced cocktail, adding grapefruit juice and a small amount of maraschino liqueur to counteract the tartness of the lime and add complexity.149

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Rum**

##### **The Profile**

The traditional base for a Daiquiri is a light, Cuban-style **white rum**.150 This style of rum is column-distilled from molasses, typically lightly aged and then charcoal-filtered to remove colour. The result is a rum that is clean, crisp, and dry, with subtle notes of vanilla, citrus, and tropical fruit. This profile provides the perfect canvas for the fresh citrus and complex liqueur in the Hemingway Special.

##### **Top Recommendation (The Cuban Standard): Havana Club Añejo 3 Años**

For an authentic Hemingway Special, **Havana Club Añejo 3 Años** is the definitive choice. As the quintessential Cuban rum available internationally, it provides the exact flavour profile that the drink was built around.151 Its notes of vanilla, banana, and light oak are perfectly suited to the cocktail's other ingredients. It is widely available in the UK.

##### **Second Recommendation (The Bartender's Blend): Plantation 3 Stars**

A favourite among modern bartenders, **Plantation 3 Stars** is a blend of rums from Barbados, Trinidad, and Jamaica.152 It is crafted to be an ideal white rum for daiquiris, offering a clean, crisp profile with a touch more complexity and a hint of Jamaican funk than a standard Cuban-style rum. It makes an exceptionally flavourful Hemingway Special.

##### **Alternative Consideration (The American Craft): Hamilton White 'Stache**

For a more artisanal take, **Hamilton White 'Stache** is a highly-regarded white rum blend specifically designed for daiquiris.152 It is a blend of rums from Trinidad, Guyana, and the Dominican Republic, offering a slightly richer and "rummier" profile than many other white rums. It is a fantastic choice for elevating the cocktail.

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Maraschino Luxardo**

##### **The Standard**

The specified liqueur in the recipe is **Luxardo Maraschino Originale**. This is a classic Italian liqueur distilled from Marasca cherries, including the pits, which imparts a unique nutty, almond-like flavour alongside the sour cherry notes.149 It is not the sweet, syrupy liquid from a jar of cocktail cherries. Its role in the Hemingway Special is crucial: it provides the necessary sweetness to balance the tart lime and grapefruit juices, while also adding a complex floral and fruity depth.154 There is no direct substitute for its unique flavour profile. Luxardo Maraschino is a staple of any good cocktail bar and is available in the UK from specialist retailers.155

### **Horse’s Neck**

The Horse's Neck is a classic highball cocktail with origins dating back to the late 19th century. It began its life as a non-alcoholic drink made of ginger ale and a very long lemon peel garnish, which snaked around the inside of the glass and resembled a horse's neck.157 Around 1910, a measure of brandy or bourbon was added to create a "Horse's Neck with a Kick".157 The modern version typically features Cognac or bourbon, ginger ale, and an optional dash of Angostura bitters, which adds aromatic complexity.

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Cognac**

##### **The Profile**

When made with Cognac, the Horse's Neck is a smooth, elegant, and refreshing long drink. A **V.S. (Very Special)** or **V.S.O.P. (Very Superior Old Pale)** Cognac is the ideal choice. These grades have enough character and fruit-forward notes to stand up to the ginger ale without being overly dominated by oak, as a more expensive XO might be. The Cognac's notes of grape, vanilla, and spice are a natural match for the ginger and lemon.

##### **Top Recommendation (The Classic): Hennessy V.S.O.P Privilège**

**Hennessy V.S.O.P** is a superb and frequently recommended choice for a Horse's Neck.158 Its well-balanced profile, with notes of vanilla, toasted oak, and light spice, harmonizes perfectly with the ginger ale. It creates a sophisticated, smooth, and modern version of the cocktail. Hennessy is widely available in the UK.161

##### **Second Recommendation (The Value Choice): Courvoisier V.S.**

For a high-quality yet more affordable option, **Courvoisier V.S.** is an excellent choice. It is known for its fresh, fruity, and floral character, with notes of ripe pear and spring flowers. This lighter profile makes for a particularly refreshing and easy-drinking Horse's Neck.

##### **Alternative Consideration (The Craft Choice): Normandin-Mercier Petite Champagne Cognac VSOP**

For a more artisanal expression, a craft Cognac like **Normandin-Mercier VSOP** offers a different level of complexity.163 These smaller-batch Cognacs often have more distinct and nuanced flavour profiles that can add significant depth to a simple highball like the Horse's Neck.

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Ginger Ale**

##### **The Profile**

The choice of ginger ale is crucial. Unlike the fiery ginger beer used in a Dark 'N' Stormy, a Horse's Neck calls for the milder, crisper, and less sweet profile of ginger ale. A good quality ginger ale should have a clean, authentic ginger flavour and lively carbonation to lift the drink.

##### **Top Recommendation (The Premium Mixer): Fever-Tree Premium Ginger Ale**

Just as their ginger beer is a top choice for its category, **Fever-Tree Premium Ginger Ale** is an outstanding option for a Horse's Neck.164 It is made with a blend of three different gingers, resulting in a clean, nuanced, and authentic ginger flavour that is not overly sweet. Its high carbonation ensures a refreshing and lively drink. It is widely available in UK supermarkets.

##### **Second Recommendation (The Classic Standard): Schweppes Ginger Ale**

**Schweppes Ginger Ale** is the classic, traditional choice and is hard to beat for this specific drink.165 It has a familiar, milder ginger profile and a good level of fizz that has been the standard for this highball for decades. It is available in every UK supermarket.

##### **Alternative Consideration (The Bartender's Pick): Thomas Henry Ginger Ale**

A German brand popular with bartenders, **Thomas Henry Ginger Ale** is noted for its clean taste, high carbonation, and a growing spicy warmth.165 It offers a slightly more intense ginger experience than Schweppes without straying into the territory of ginger beer, making it an excellent choice for a flavourful Horse's Neck.

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Angostura Bitters (optional)**

##### **The Standard**

While optional, a few dashes of **Angostura Aromatic Bitters** are highly recommended to complete the Horse's Neck.157 Angostura adds a layer of aromatic complexity, with notes of clove, cinnamon, and gentian, which bridges the gap between the sweet spice of the Cognac and the sharp spice of the ginger ale. It transforms the drink from a simple two-ingredient highball into a more structured and sophisticated cocktail. Angostura bitters are an essential bar ingredient and are widely available in UK supermarkets and specialist retailers.168

### **IBA Tiki**

This cocktail appears to be a unique, complex recipe rather than a widely recognized classic. Its name suggests it was created for an International Bartenders Association (IBA) event. The ingredient list is extensive and specific, pointing to a modern Tiki creation that requires careful sourcing of several distinct spirits and liqueurs. The analysis will focus on the specified brands and provide context and potential substitutes where the specified items are obscure or unavailable.

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Ron Profundo Havana Club**

##### **The Specified Spirit**

"Ron Profundo" is not a standard, commercially available expression from Havana Club in the UK market.171 A search for this product suggests it may be a special designation, a regional release (potentially available in Cuba itself), or an older, discontinued bottling.173 The name translates to "Deep Rum," which implies a dark, aged, and flavourful rum. Given the context of a Tiki drink, this would likely be a rum with notes of molasses, dark fruit, and spice.

##### **Suitable Substitutes**

To replicate the intended profile of a "deep" Cuban rum, the best approach is to use one of Havana Club's more premium, aged expressions that are available in the UK.

* **Top Recommendation: Havana Club Añejo 7 Años.** This is the most logical and accessible substitute. It is a well-regarded aged Cuban rum with a complex profile of honey, vanilla, cocoa, sweet tobacco, and tropical fruits.174 Its depth and smoothness would fit the "Profundo" description perfectly. It is widely available in the UK.171  
* **Second Recommendation: Havana Club Selección de Maestros.** A more premium option, this is a triple barrel-aged rum bottled at a higher proof (45% ABV). It offers a more intense and complex flavour profile with notes of toasted pecan, spice, and dark chocolate, which would add significant depth to the cocktail.171

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Ron Smoky Havana Club**

##### **The Specified Spirit**

**Havana Club Cuban Smoky** is a specific and unique expression from the brand.175 It is a dark rum that is partly aged in peated Islay single malt whisky casks.175 This process imparts a distinct smoky and peaty character to the rum, which is highly unusual for a Cuban rum and breaks with tradition.

##### **Availability and Substitutes**

This is a specialist expression and is not as widely available as the core Havana Club range. It can be found at some online European retailers that ship to the UK, but it is not a standard stock item.176 If unavailable, a substitute would need to replicate the smoky profile.

* **DIY Approach:** The most direct way to substitute would be to use a standard dark rum (like **Havana Club 7 Años**) and add a small amount (e.g., a bar spoon) of a smoky Islay single malt whisky, such as **Laphroaig 10 Year Old** or **Ardbeg 10 Year Old**. This would allow the mixologist to control the level of smoke in the final drink.  
* **Alternative Smoky Rums:** While not Cuban, other rums with a smoky character exist, such as some Demerara rums which can have a smoky note, or specialty rums like **Renegade Rum Pre-Cask Dunfermline Column Still**, which has a peated profile.

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Licor Amaretto & Licor Frangelico**

* **Amaretto:** As a component in a complex Tiki drink, the amaretto adds a nutty sweetness and marzipan notes. A versatile and high-quality brand like **Disaronno Originale** or **Lazzaroni Amaretto** would be an excellent choice, as detailed in the French Connection analysis.88 Both are available in the UK.  
* **Frangelico:** This is a specific brand of Italian hazelnut liqueur.178 Its distinct flavour of toasted hazelnuts, cocoa, and vanilla is required for the recipe. Frangelico is the standard for this category and is widely available in UK supermarkets and specialist retailers.179

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Maraschino Luxardo**

As with the Hemingway Special, the recipe specifies **Luxardo Maraschino Originale**. Its unique, complex flavour is essential, and it is readily available in the UK.155

### **Illegal**

The name of this cocktail is likely a play on the brand name of the specified mezcal, Ilegal. It is a modern sour-style cocktail that combines the smoky notes of mezcal with the funky character of Jamaican overproof rum, balanced by the complex spice of falernum and the tartness of fresh lime.

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Espadin Mezcal**

##### **The Profile**

Mezcal is an agave spirit from Mexico, distinguished from tequila by its production process, which typically involves roasting the agave hearts in underground pits, imparting a characteristic smoky flavour. **Espadín** is the most common type of agave used for mezcal production, and it generally yields a mezcal that is well-balanced between smoky, earthy, and fruity notes, making it an excellent choice for cocktails.182

##### **Top Recommendation (The Namesake): Ilegal Mezcal Joven**

Given the cocktail's name, it is highly probable that it was designed to be made with **Ilegal Mezcal**. Their **Joven** (unaged) expression is a superb choice. It is an artisanal Espadín mezcal from Oaxaca with a balanced profile of green apple, citrus, and a gentle, lingering smoke. It is well-regarded for its mixability and is available in the UK from specialist retailers.182

##### **Second Recommendation (The Bartender's Staple): Del Maguey Vida**

**Del Maguey Vida** is another outstanding and widely available Espadín mezcal that has become a staple in craft cocktail bars worldwide.182 It has a slightly more robust smoke profile than Ilegal, with notes of ginger, cinnamon, and tropical fruit. It is an excellent and often more affordable choice for mixing. It is available from UK retailers like The Whisky Exchange.183

##### **Alternative Consideration (The Value Choice): Montelobos Espadín Joven**

**Montelobos Espadín Joven** is another high-quality, certified organic mezcal that offers great value.183 It is known for its balance of roasted agave, smoke, and a slight salinity, making it a versatile and reliable option for cocktails.

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Jamaica Overproof White Rum**

##### **The Profile**

Jamaican overproof white rum is a potent, unaged, and intensely flavourful spirit. Bottled at a high proof (typically 63% ABV), it is characterized by a very high level of esters, resulting in a powerful "funk" with notes of overripe banana, pineapple, and a distinctive grassy, savoury quality. It is used in small quantities in cocktails to add a huge burst of flavour and complexity.

##### **Top Recommendation (The Icon): Wray & Nephew White Overproof Rum**

**Wray & Nephew White Overproof Rum** is the undisputed icon and top-selling rum in this category.184 It is the definitive Jamaican overproof rum and accounts for the vast majority of rum consumed in Jamaica. Its intense, funky, and fruity profile is exactly what is required to stand up to the smoky mezcal in the "Illegal" cocktail. It is a must-have for any serious Tiki or rum enthusiast's bar and is widely available in UK supermarkets and specialist stores.186

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Falernum**

##### **The Profile**

Falernum is a sweet syrup or low-proof liqueur from the Caribbean, with a characteristic flavour profile of lime, ginger, almond, and clove. It is a cornerstone of many Tiki cocktails, adding a layer of exotic spice and sweetness. There are two main types: a non-alcoholic syrup and a low-ABV liqueur, often called Velvet Falernum.188

##### **Top Recommendation (The Liqueur): John D. Taylor's Velvet Falernum**

**John D. Taylor's Velvet Falernum** is the most common and widely available liqueur version.189 It has a subtle, sweet, and spicy profile at  
11% ABV. It is a reliable and classic choice for any cocktail requiring falernum. It is available in the UK from specialist online retailers.190

##### **Second Recommendation (The Syrup): B.G. Reynolds Falernum Syrup**

For those who prefer a non-alcoholic syrup to have more control over the cocktail's final sweetness and ABV, **B.G. Reynolds Falernum Syrup** is a highly-regarded craft option. It is known for having a more pronounced spice and citrus character than the liqueur versions.189

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Maraschino Luxardo**

The recipe calls for a bar spoon of **Luxardo Maraschino Originale**. As in other cocktails, its unique flavour is a key component, and it is readily available in the UK.155

### **Irish Coffee**

The Irish Coffee is a world-famous hot cocktail, a perfect marriage of strong, hot coffee, smooth Irish whiskey, sugar, and a thick layer of lightly whipped, cold cream. Created in 1943 at Foynes Airport in Ireland, its success depends on the quality of its components and the correct technique, particularly in ensuring the cream floats perfectly on top of the hot coffee and whiskey mixture.59

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Irish Whiskey**

##### **The Profile**

The ideal Irish whiskey for an Irish Coffee is a smooth, approachable blend. Single malts or pot still whiskeys can be excellent but may have flavour profiles that are too assertive or complex, potentially clashing with the coffee. A classic blended Irish whiskey, which typically contains a mix of grain and malt or pot still whiskey, offers a perfect balance of sweetness, fruitiness, and a smooth finish that complements the coffee without overpowering it.59

##### **Top Recommendation (The Original): Powers Gold Label**

According to historical accounts, **Powers Gold Label** was the whiskey used in the very first Irish Coffee created by Joe Sheridan in 1943\.59 It is a classic blend with a robust and spicy character, thanks to a high proportion of pot still whiskey in the mix. Its notes of cinnamon, pepper, and honey make it a flavourful and authentic choice.

##### **Second Recommendation (The Global Standard): Jameson Irish Whiskey**

**Jameson** is the world's best-selling Irish whiskey and a fantastic, reliable choice for an Irish Coffee.59 Its signature smoothness and balanced profile of vanilla, nutty, and sweet sherry notes make it an incredibly versatile and crowd-pleasing option that melds seamlessly with coffee and sugar. It is available in every pub and supermarket in the UK.

##### **Alternative Consideration (The American Classic): Tullamore D.E.W. Original**

**Tullamore D.E.W.** is famously the whiskey of choice for the Buena Vista Cafe in San Francisco, the bar that popularized the Irish Coffee in America and is now the world's largest single purveyor of the drink.192 It is a triple blend of grain, malt, and pot still whiskeys, giving it a unique complexity with notes of fruit, spice, and a gentle sweetness, making it a historically significant and excellent choice for the cocktail.192

### **John Collins**

The John Collins is a classic long drink that is part of the Collins family of cocktails. It is essentially a Gin Sour lengthened with soda water, served over ice in a tall glass. There is often confusion between the John Collins and the Tom Collins. Historically and according to purists, a **Tom Collins** is made specifically with Old Tom gin, while a **John Collins** is made with London Dry Gin.118 For modern purposes, the two names are often used interchangeably for a gin-based Collins.

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Gin**

##### **The Profile**

The gin for a John Collins should be a classic, well-balanced **London Dry Gin**. The cocktail is simple and refreshing, so the gin's botanical character—particularly its juniper and citrus notes—should be clean and present, providing a crisp backbone for the lemon and soda.194

##### **Top Recommendation (The All-Rounder): Beefeater London Dry Gin**

**Beefeater London Dry Gin** is consistently recommended as an ideal choice for a Collins.194 Its strong citrus notes of lemon and Seville orange peel are a perfect match for the fresh lemon juice in the recipe, while its robust juniper character ensures it doesn't get lost in the mix. Its balance and quality make it a top choice.

##### **Second Recommendation (The Classic): Tanqueray London Dry Gin**

**Tanqueray London Dry Gin** is another excellent option, known for its crisp, juniper-forward profile.195 It creates a classic, clean, and bracing John Collins. Its relative simplicity, focusing on four key botanicals, allows the essential character of the gin to shine through.

##### **Alternative Consideration (The Versatile): Portobello Road No. 171 Gin**

Named "Best in a Tom Collins" by *Good Housekeeping*, **Portobello Road No. 171 Gin** is a modern London Dry that is highly versatile.198 It has a traditional juniper and citrus profile, but with a distinctive peppery finish from the inclusion of cassia bark and nutmeg, which adds an extra layer of spice and complexity to the drink.

### **Jungle Bird**

The Jungle Bird is a unique and iconic Tiki cocktail that stands out for its surprising inclusion of a bitter Italian aperitif. Created in the 1970s at the Aviary Bar in the Kuala Lumpur Hilton, the drink combines dark rum, pineapple juice, lime juice, and sugar with a significant measure of Campari.104 This unusual pairing works beautifully, with the Campari's bitterness cutting through the sweetness of the pineapple and rum, creating a complex, balanced, and deeply refreshing tropical drink.199

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Blackstrap rum**

##### **The Profile**

The original Jungle Bird recipe called for a generic "dark Jamaican rum." However, the modern resurgence of the cocktail, popularized by New York bartender Giuseppe Gonzalez, champions the use of **blackstrap rum**.200 Blackstrap rum is a very dark, full-bodied rum with an intense, rich flavour of blackstrap molasses, coffee, and licorice. Its robust and slightly bitter character is a perfect match for the Campari.

##### **Top Recommendation (The Modern Standard): Cruzan Black Strap Rum**

**Cruzan Black Strap Rum** is the specific rum that Gonzalez used in his influential version of the Jungle Bird, and it has since become the modern standard for the drink.200 Its deep, rich molasses flavour provides a powerful base that can stand up to the other strong ingredients. While availability in the UK can be limited, it can be sourced through specialist online retailers that import from the US or Europe.203

##### **Second Recommendation (The Jamaican Alternative): Goslings Black Seal Rum**

If Cruzan Black Strap is unavailable, a rich, dark rum like **Goslings Black Seal Rum** is an excellent and widely available alternative.206 While technically a dark Bermudan rum, its profile is rich with molasses and caramel notes that work very well in the Jungle Bird.

##### **Alternative Consideration (The Funky Option): A Dark Jamaican Rum**

To hew closer to the original recipe's specification, a flavourful dark Jamaican rum like **Coruba Dark** or **Myers's Original Dark** can be used. These rums will bring more of the characteristic Jamaican "funk" to the cocktail, resulting in a fruitier and more ester-driven version of the drink.

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Campari**

The inclusion of **Campari** is what makes the Jungle Bird unique.104 Its bitter, herbal, and citrus notes are essential to the cocktail's balance, cutting through the sweetness of the rum and pineapple juice. There is no substitute for Campari in this recipe. It is widely available in all UK supermarkets.

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Demerara sugar syrup**

##### **The Profile**

Demerara syrup is a "rich" simple syrup made with demerara sugar, a minimally processed cane sugar with a high molasses content. It has a richer, more complex flavour than simple syrup made with white sugar, with notes of caramel, toffee, and molasses.207 This depth of flavour is a key component in many Tiki and rum cocktails.

##### **Top Recommendation (The DIY Method): Homemade Demerara Syrup**

As with other syrups, making it at home provides the best flavour and quality. A **rich demerara syrup** is made with a 2:1 ratio of demerara sugar to water.208 Gently heat the water and sugar, stirring until the sugar is fully dissolved, then allow it to cool before bottling. This is the preferred method for most craft bartenders.208

##### **Commercial Options**

For convenience, several brands offer pre-made demerara syrup.

* **Jack Rudy Demerara Sugar Syrup:** A high-quality American brand that produces a rich, flavourful demerara syrup. It is available in the UK from specialist retailers like The Whisky Exchange.210  
* **Bristol Syrup Co. Demerara Sugar Syrup:** A UK-based company that produces a range of high-quality syrups for the bar trade, their demerara syrup is another excellent choice.

### **Kir**

The Kir is a classic and simple French *apéritif*, consisting of a small amount of crème de cassis (blackcurrant liqueur) topped with a dry white wine. It is named after Félix Kir, a mayor of Dijon in Burgundy, who famously served the drink to promote two of the region's local products: Aligoté wine and crème de cassis.211 The drink's charm lies in its simplicity and the delightful interplay between the tart, acidic wine and the sweet, fruity liqueur. When made with Champagne or other sparkling wine, it is known as a Kir Royale.

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Dry White Wine**

##### **The Profile**

The wine for a Kir must be dry, crisp, and have a good level of acidity to balance the sweetness of the crème de cassis.212 An unoaked white wine is essential, as the flavours of oak would clash with the fresh fruit of the liqueur. The wine should be something pleasant to drink on its own but not so expensive or complex that its nuances would be lost in the mix.213

##### **Top Recommendation (The Traditional): Bourgogne Aligoté**

The traditional and authentic wine for a Kir is **Bourgogne Aligoté**.212 Aligoté is Burgundy's "other" white grape, known for producing wines that are light-bodied, crisp, and minerally, with notes of green apple and citrus. Its high acidity makes it the perfect foil for the sweet cassis. A good quality Bourgogne Aligoté can be found at specialist wine merchants in the UK.

##### **Second Recommendation (The Widely Available): Sauvignon Blanc**

A crisp, unoaked **Sauvignon Blanc**, particularly from the Loire Valley in France (such as a Touraine or a Sancerre), is a very popular and excellent alternative.213 Its characteristic high acidity and grassy, citrusy notes of grapefruit and gooseberry provide the necessary freshness to create a well-balanced Kir. Many good value examples are available in UK supermarkets.216

##### **Alternative Considerations**

Other dry, unoaked white wines also work very well.

* **Pinot Blanc:** Known as *Weissburgunder* in Germany or *Pinot Bianco* in Italy, this grape produces wines with a subtle profile of apple, citrus, and almond, along with good acidity.215  
* **Muscadet:** From the western Loire Valley, Muscadet is a bone-dry, light-bodied wine with high acidity and a distinctive saline or mineral character that makes for a very crisp and refreshing Kir.

#### **Ingredient Analysis: Crème de Cassis**

##### **The Profile**

Crème de cassis is a sweet, dark red liqueur made from blackcurrants. The quality can vary significantly, so it is important to choose a reputable brand. A good crème de cassis should have a rich, deep, and authentic blackcurrant flavour, with a thick, viscous texture and an alcohol content of around 15% to 20% ABV.213 The best examples come from the region of Dijon in Burgundy.211

##### **Top Recommendation (The Burgundian): Gabriel Boudier Crème de Cassis de Dijon**

From a historic and highly respected producer in Dijon, **Gabriel Boudier Crème de Cassis** is an exceptional choice. It is made using the highest quality blackcurrants and is known for its intense, authentic fruit flavour and perfect balance of sweetness and tartness.

##### **Second Recommendation (The Widely Available): Giffard Crème de Cassis Impérial**

**Giffard Crème de Cassis Impérial** is another high-quality French option that is widely available in the UK, including at retailers like Majestic Wine.217 It has a rich, full-bodied blackcurrant flavour and is an excellent all-purpose choice for a Kir or Kir Royale.218

##### **Alternative Consideration (The Dutch Standard): De Kuyper or Bols Crème de Cassis**

Brands like **De Kuyper** and **Bols** produce reliable and affordable crème de cassis that is widely available in UK supermarkets like Waitrose.218 While they may not have the same depth and complexity as the premium Burgundian options, they are perfectly suitable for making a pleasant Kir.

### **Last Word**

A formidable, challenging, and utterly rewarding cocktail, the Last Word is a Prohibition-era classic born at the Detroit Athletic Club.1 It is a drink of perfect equilibrium, a four-part harmony where gin, Green Chartreuse, maraschino liqueur, and lime juice each command equal respect. Its resurgence in the modern cocktail renaissance is a testament to its sophisticated and complex profile; it is a drink that demands high-quality components, as there is nowhere for a lesser ingredient to hide.3

#### **Ingredient: Gin**

##### **Profile Requirements**

The gin in a Last Word must possess a strong character to assert itself against the herbal intensity of Green Chartreuse and the unique funk of maraschino liqueur. A classic London Dry style is the consensus choice, providing a necessary juniper-and-botanical backbone.4 However, the key is balance; a gin that is overwhelmingly juniper-forward can disrupt the cocktail's delicate interplay.7 Many experts and enthusiasts also favour a higher-proof gin (above 43% ABV), as the additional strength provides a structural framework that prevents the spirit from being lost amidst the other powerful ingredients.1

##### **Primary Recommendation: Tanqueray London Dry Gin**

* **Analysis**: Tanqueray is frequently recommended across professional and enthusiast platforms for its crisp, assertive, juniper-led profile that provides a classic backbone without overpowering the other components.4 Its well-defined botanical blend of juniper, coriander, angelica, and liquorice is robust enough to stand firm against the Chartreuse, making it a quintessential "bartender's choice" for this drink.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in all major UK supermarkets, including Tesco, Sainsbury's, and Morrisons. The typical price is £20-£25 for a 70cl bottle.9

##### **Secondary Recommendation: Plymouth Gin**

* **Analysis**: Often recommended for its smoother, slightly sweeter, and earthier character, which creates a softer, more integrated Last Word.3 The historic Plymouth Navy Strength gin, bottled at 57% ABV, is specifically cited by aficionados as a superior choice, underscoring the importance of proof in providing the cocktail's structure and intensity.6  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available in major supermarkets like Tesco and specialist retailers such as The Whisky Exchange. The standard strength (41.2% ABV) typically costs £25-£28 for a 70cl bottle.11

##### **Accessible Choice: Beefeater London Dry Gin**

* **Analysis**: A classic, reliable, and cost-effective London Dry that serves as a solid foundation for a wide range of cocktails, including the Last Word.5 While some enthusiasts note the recent reduction of its ABV in the UK to 40% as a slight drawback for such a robust cocktail, it remains a globally respected standard praised for its bold juniper and citrus notes.6  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Ubiquitous in UK supermarkets. The price is generally in the £18-£21 range for a 70cl bottle.13

##### **Artisanal Choice: Sipsmith London Dry Gin**

* **Analysis**: Frequently mentioned as a premium option that elevates the cocktail, Sipsmith offers a particularly bright and complex botanical profile that interacts beautifully with the herbal and floral notes of the other ingredients.4 Its classic, uncompromising London Dry character makes it an excellent choice for a more refined Last Word.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available in most major supermarkets and specialist retailers. The price is typically £28-£31 for a 70cl bottle.15

#### **Ingredient: Green Chartreuse**

##### **The Standard**

Green Chartreuse is the soul of the Last Word; it is non-negotiable and functionally irreplaceable. Its secret recipe, comprising 130 herbs and botanicals known only to two Carthusian monks, has been guarded since 1605\.3 This liqueur provides the cocktail's signature pungent, complex, and layered herbal character. The green version is stronger (55% ABV), more intensely herbaceous, and less sweet than its yellow counterpart, and it is the historically correct and essential choice for this drink.1

##### **UK Availability & Price**

Due to a conscious decision by the monks not to increase production despite soaring demand, Green Chartreuse is often subject to allocation and shortages, making it a prized bottle in any collection.4 It is almost exclusively available through specialist UK retailers such as The Whisky Exchange, Master of Malt, Spirit Store, and Drinks Direct. Expect to pay between £48 and £58 for a 70cl bottle.19

##### **Noteworthy Alternatives**

While no spirit can truly substitute for Green Chartreuse, in times of scarcity, enthusiasts have experimented with other complex herbal liqueurs. Products like Dolin Génépy or the Italian Liquore Strega can create interesting, palatable variations, but they will not replicate the unique and profound profile of the original.18

#### **Ingredient: Maraschino Liqueur (Luxardo)**

##### **Confirmation of Standard**

The user's specification of Luxardo Maraschino Liqueur is correct and confirmed by overwhelming consensus as the definitive choice for the Last Word.1 Its profile is critical to the cocktail's balance. Unlike sweeter cherry brandies or liqueurs, Luxardo Maraschino is relatively dry, clear, and possesses a complex, funky, and slightly bitter almond note derived from the crushed pits of the Marasca cherries used in its production.3 This unique character is essential.

##### **Notable Alternatives**

While Luxardo is the benchmark, other high-quality, traditional maraschino liqueurs, such as Maraska from Croatia, can be used.18 The crucial factor is that the spirit must be a true  
*maraschino liqueur*—distilled from Marasca cherries—and not a generic, sweet "cherry liqueur," which would render the cocktail unbalanced and cloying.24

### **Lemon Drop Martini**

A modern classic born in the 1970s, the Lemon Drop Martini is celebrated for its perfect synthesis of sweet and tart, evoking the nostalgic flavour of the lemon drop candy.25 It is, in essence, a vodka sour served "up" in a martini glass, traditionally with a sugared rim that adds both texture and a balancing sweetness to the zesty citrus profile.27 Its simplicity belies a need for quality ingredients, as there are few components to mask any imperfections.

#### **Ingredient: Vodka**

##### **Profile Requirements**

The ideal vodka for a Lemon Drop Martini is, above all, smooth and clean. While some recipes are permissive, suggesting any vodka will suffice, the minimal ingredient list means that a higher-quality spirit will produce a noticeably superior cocktail.27 A neutral grain profile serves as the perfect canvas, though citrus-infused vodkas (Citron) are a popular and effective variation that enhances the primary flavour.30

##### **Primary Recommendation: Ketel One**

* **Analysis**: Frequently cited by professionals and enthusiasts as a premium, exceptionally smooth vodka that is ideal for martini-style cocktails.33 Its character is crisp and clean, with subtle hints of honey and citrus that elegantly complement the cocktail's profile without introducing any harsh or unwanted flavours. It represents a significant upgrade in texture and finish over standard vodkas.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in major UK supermarkets like Waitrose and Sainsbury's, as well as specialist retailers. The price is typically in the £26-£28 range for a 70cl bottle.35

##### **Secondary Recommendation: Tito's Handmade Vodka**

* **Analysis**: An immensely popular American craft vodka, noted for the smooth profile it derives from its 100% corn base.27 While some bartenders on community forums view its dominance as a result of savvy marketing—particularly its "gluten-free" labelling, a characteristic of all distilled spirits—its widespread popularity and reliably smooth character make it a very solid choice for a clean cocktail like the Lemon Drop.34  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available in major supermarkets like Sainsbury's and specialist retailers such as The Whisky Exchange. A 70cl bottle typically costs £25-£28.37

##### **Accessible Choice: Smirnoff No. 21**

* **Analysis**: A reliable, affordable, and globally recognised vodka that performs perfectly well in a mixed drink where citrus is the star.34 Its triple-distilled, charcoal-filtered process ensures a neutral canvas, allowing the fresh lemon and orange liqueur to express themselves fully.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Ubiquitous in all supermarkets and off-licences. The price is generally £16-£18 for a 70cl bottle.16

##### **Variation Choice: Absolut Citron**

* **Analysis**: For those who wish to amplify the cocktail's signature flavour, Absolut Citron is the classic choice. Infused with natural lemon flavour, it enhances the citrus notes without adding any sweetness, creating a more intensely zesty and aromatic drink.31

#### **Ingredient: Triple Sec**

##### **Profile Requirements**

The orange liqueur in a Lemon Drop is not merely a sweetener; it adds crucial citrus depth, complexity, and aroma that balances the tartness of the lemon juice.40 The quality of this component is paramount. Inexpensive, generic triple secs can be overly sweet and one-dimensional, whereas premium versions offer a cleaner, more complex, and balanced orange character that elevates the entire drink.

##### **Primary Recommendation: Cointreau**

* **Analysis**: The overwhelming consensus choice among experts, bartenders, and recipe developers for any serious citrus-forward cocktail.26 Cointreau is a specific, premium brand of triple sec, distinguished by its use of both sweet and bitter orange peels, its higher strength (40% ABV), and its crystal-clear, less syrupy profile. It is consistently cited as the single most important upgrade for a Lemon Drop, Margarita, or Cosmopolitan, providing a bright, clean orange perfume that is perfectly balanced.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in all major supermarkets and specialist retailers. A 70cl bottle typically costs £26-£28, with smaller 50cl bottles commonly available for around £19.41

##### **Secondary Recommendation: Grand Marnier Cordon Rouge**

* **Analysis**: This offers an interesting but distinctly different profile. As a blend of cognac and bitter orange liqueur, Grand Marnier creates a richer, sweeter, and more complex Lemon Drop with deeper notes of caramelised orange and oak.32 It is an excellent choice for experimentation and for those who prefer a more decadent cocktail, but it deviates from the classic crisp and zesty profile.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in supermarkets and specialist retailers. The price is generally £28-£32 for a 70cl bottle.

##### **Accessible Choice: DeKuyper Triple Sec**

* **Analysis**: A standard, widely available, and economical triple sec. While it lacks the refinement and complexity of Cointreau, it is an acceptable and functional choice for home bartending, providing the necessary orange sweetness for the cocktail's balance.26  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available in major supermarkets like Tesco. The price is typically £9-£11 for a 35cl bottle.41

The choice of orange liqueur presents a clear example of strategic purchasing for a home bar. While a generic triple sec is the most budget-friendly option for a single cocktail, investing in a bottle of Cointreau provides a significant quality upgrade across multiple drinks on this list, including the Long Island Iced Tea and Margarita. This single, higher-quality purchase elevates a substantial portion of the cocktail repertoire, representing a high return on investment in terms of overall drink quality and versatility.

### **Long Island Iced Tea**

An infamous and potent cocktail that, despite its name and appearance, contains no tea. The Long Island Iced Tea is a lesson in synergy, where five distinct white spirits—vodka, tequila, rum, gin, and triple sec—combine with citrus and cola to create a surprisingly cohesive and palatable drink. The key to elevating this drink from a notorious dive bar staple to a respectable cocktail lies in using fresh citrus juice and solid, reliable spirits. While top-shelf brands would be wasted, using 100% agave tequila and avoiding the lowest-quality spirits is essential.

#### **Ingredient: Vodka**

* **Analysis**: A neutral, clean vodka is all that is required. The spirit's individual character will be lost among the other four, so a reliable and accessible brand is the ideal choice.  
* **Recommendation: Smirnoff No. 21** or **Absolut**. Both are excellent, widely available options that provide the necessary alcoholic base without introducing unwanted flavours.43

#### **Ingredient: Tequila**

* **Analysis**: Using a 100% blue weber agave tequila is non-negotiable for a smooth, balanced drink. A "mixto" tequila will introduce harshness. A blanco (or silver) style is required for its clean, crisp agave profile.  
* **Recommendations: Espolòn Blanco** or **El Jimador Silver**. Both are highly regarded as excellent value, 100% agave tequilas that are perfect for mixing. They provide clean agave notes without astringency, making them ideal for a multi-spirit cocktail like this.44

#### **Ingredient: White Rum**

* **Analysis**: A clean, light, column-distilled rum is the standard. The goal is a neutral sugarcane spirit character that blends seamlessly.  
* **Recommendations: Bacardi Superior Carta Blanca** or **Plantation 3 Stars**. Bacardi is the classic, ubiquitous choice, offering a dry and light profile.43 Plantation 3 Stars is a bartender favourite that blends rums from Barbados, Jamaica, and Trinidad for a slightly more complex but still clean character.

#### **Ingredient: Gin**

* **Analysis**: A straightforward, inexpensive London Dry gin is the perfect fit. Its primary role is to contribute its botanical proof without asserting any single dominant flavour.  
* **Recommendations: Gordon's London Dry Gin** or **Beefeater London Dry Gin**. Both are quintessential, juniper-forward workhorse gins that are ideal for this cocktail and represent excellent value.43

#### **Ingredient: Cointreau**

* **Analysis**: The user has specified Cointreau, which is the premium choice for the orange liqueur component. This single ingredient significantly elevates the cocktail, providing a clean, complex orange character that is far superior to generic, syrupy triple secs.43 It is the correct and best-in-class choice.

### **Mai-Tai**

The undisputed king of Tiki cocktails, the Mai Tai is a sublime and complex creation attributed to Victor "Trader Vic" Bergeron in 1944\.48 A true Mai Tai is a carefully balanced interplay of aged rum, the nutty-floral notes of orgeat syrup, a high-quality orange liqueur, and fresh lime. The choice of rum is the most critical and widely debated element, as the original recipe was built around a specific, now-extinct 17-year-old Jamaican rum from J. Wray & Nephew.48 Replicating its unique character is the key to an authentic experience.

#### **Ingredient: Amber Jamaican Rum**

##### **Profile Requirements**

This component must provide the "funk" or high level of esters characteristic of traditional Jamaican pot-still rums. This funk manifests as complex notes of tropical fruits (like banana and pineapple), molasses, and a rich, weighty body that forms the cocktail's backbone.48

##### **Primary Recommendation: Appleton Estate 8 Year Old Reserve**

* **Analysis**: This is a benchmark for a quality, blended aged Jamaican rum. It offers a perfect balance of characteristic Jamaican funk with the smoothness and complexity of oak aging, featuring notes of honey, vanilla, and orange peel.48 It is widely available and makes a superb one-rum Mai Tai or a perfect base for a blend.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in major supermarkets and specialist retailers. The price is typically £28-£33 for a 70cl bottle.51

##### **Secondary Recommendation: Smith & Cross Traditional Jamaica Rum**

* **Analysis**: A favourite among Tiki enthusiasts, Smith & Cross is a higher-proof (57% ABV), pot-still rum that delivers a powerful dose of Jamaican funk.48 It is more aggressive and less refined than the Appleton 8 Year, making it an excellent component to use in a blend to add punch and complexity.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available from specialist UK retailers like The Whisky Exchange and Amathus Drinks. The price is typically £40-£49 for a 70cl bottle.55

#### **Ingredient: Martinique Molasses Rhum**

##### **Profile Requirements**

This is a historically nuanced ingredient. While modern recipes often call for *rhum agricole* from Martinique (distilled from fresh sugarcane juice), historical research suggests Trader Vic's "Second Adjusted Formula" used a molasses-based rum from Martinique, which was darker and more pungent.48 This spirit is no longer commercially available, leading to two distinct modern approaches.

##### **Primary Recommendation (The Single-Bottle Solution): Denizen Merchant's Reserve**

* **Analysis**: This rum was specifically created in collaboration with Tiki historian Martin Cate to solve the Mai Tai rum problem. It is a masterful blend of aged Jamaican pot-still rum and a rare molasses-based *rhum grande arôme* from Martinique, designed to replicate the flavour profile of Trader Vic's original blend.48 For the home bartender seeking an authentic flavour with a single bottle, this is the definitive answer.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: This is an American product and is not widely distributed in the UK. It may be found through specialist importers or US-based retailers that ship internationally, but availability is extremely limited.59

##### **Alternative (The Modern Agricole Approach): Rhum Clément VSOP**

* **Analysis**: For those unable to source Denizen or who prefer the modern interpretation, a quality aged *rhum agricole* is used. Rhum Clément VSOP offers grassy, vegetal notes balanced by oak, vanilla, and spice from aging. It creates a delicious, though historically different, Mai Tai when blended with a Jamaican rum.48  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available from specialist UK retailers like Amathus Drinks and Great Wine Co. The price is typically £39-£42 for a 70cl bottle.65

#### **Ingredient: Orange Curaçao**

##### **Profile Requirements**

A high-quality, typically brandy-based, orange liqueur is essential. It should have a drier profile than standard triple sec, with notes of bitter orange peel and spice to complement the rum and orgeat.

##### **Primary Recommendation: Pierre Ferrand Dry Curaçao**

* **Analysis**: Widely considered the gold standard for Tiki and classic cocktails. Based on a 19th-century recipe, it uses brandy and cognac as its base and is flavoured with bitter Laraha orange peels. It provides unparalleled depth, complexity, and a dry finish that is perfect for the Mai Tai.69  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available from specialist UK retailers like The Whisky Exchange and Master of Malt. The price is typically £30-£34 for a 70cl bottle.71

##### **Secondary Recommendation: Clément Créole Shrubb**

* **Analysis**: A unique alternative based on *rhum agricole* rather than brandy. It offers a vibrant, spicy orange character with underlying grassy notes that pair exceptionally well with the rums in a Mai Tai.69  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available from specialist UK retailers. The price is typically £30-£35 for a 70cl bottle.

#### **Ingredient: Orgeat Syrup (Almond)**

##### **Profile Requirements**

Quality is crucial; avoid artificially flavoured syrups which can ruin the drink. A proper orgeat should be made from real almonds and have a creamy texture with subtle floral notes from orange blossom or rose water.74

##### **Primary Recommendation: Premium Craft Syrups**

* **Analysis**: For the best possible Mai Tai, a craft-made orgeat is recommended. Brands like **Liquid Alchemist** 74 (if available via import) or UK-based producers such as  
  **William Fox** 75 and  
  **Bristol Syrup Company** offer syrups made with high-quality ingredients that provide the authentic rich, nutty flavour.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available from specialist online retailers and bar suppliers. Prices vary but are typically in the £8-£15 range for a 70-75cl bottle.

##### **Accessible Choice: Monin Orgeat Syrup**

* **Analysis**: Monin is the industry standard for syrups and is a reliable and widely available option. While it may not have the complexity of small-batch brands, it provides a consistent and pleasant almond flavour suitable for home use.76  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available from specialist retailers like The Whisky Exchange and online coffee/syrup suppliers. The price is typically £7-£10 for a 70cl bottle.76

### **Manhattan**

The Manhattan is a cornerstone of classic cocktail culture, an elegant and spirit-forward drink that dates back to the late 19th century. It is a sublime trinity of whiskey, sweet vermouth, and aromatic bitters. While bourbon can be used, the traditional and arguably superior choice is rye whiskey, whose inherent spice provides a perfect counterpoint to the rich, herbal sweetness of the vermouth.78

#### **Ingredient: Rye Whiskey**

##### **Profile Requirements**

A good Manhattan requires a rye whiskey with enough character and proof to stand up to the vermouth. A higher rye content in the mash bill will provide more of the signature spice, while a higher proof (ideally 45% ABV or more) ensures the whiskey's profile is not diluted or overpowered.

##### **Primary Recommendation: Rittenhouse Straight Rye Whisky Bottled-in-Bond**

* **Analysis**: A perennial favourite among bartenders for its exceptional quality, high proof (50% ABV), and excellent value.79 As a "Bottled-in-Bond" whiskey, it is aged at least four years. It has just enough rye in the mash bill (51%) to be legally classified as such, giving it a perfect balance of peppery spice and the rich caramel notes of a bourbon, making it an ideal and robust base for a Manhattan.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available from specialist UK retailers like The Whisky Exchange, Master of Malt, and Spiritly. It is sometimes sold via Tesco's online marketplace. The price is typically £41-£49 for a 70cl bottle.82

##### **Secondary Recommendation: Sagamore Spirit Signature Rye**

* **Analysis**: A Maryland-style rye that offers a slightly softer, more approachable profile than many spicier ryes. It features pleasant notes of candied citrus and baking spices like cinnamon and clove, which meld beautifully with sweet vermouth to create a very elegant and balanced Manhattan.78  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available from specialist UK retailers. The price is typically £50-£55 for a 70cl bottle.86

##### **Premium Choice: Michter's US\*1 Kentucky Straight Rye**

* **Analysis**: A superb single-barrel rye known for its exceptional smoothness and complexity. It presents a sophisticated profile of spice, salted caramel, and butterscotch that creates a truly luxurious Manhattan.79 While a significant investment, it is a bottle that rewards in a spirit-forward cocktail.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available from premium and specialist retailers like The Whisky Exchange, Majestic, and Secret Bottle Shop. The price is typically £58-£64 for a 70cl bottle.91

#### **Ingredient: Sweet Red Vermouth**

##### **Profile Requirements**

The vermouth must be rich and complex, with a balance of sweetness, herbal bitterness, and dark fruit or spice notes. This is not a place for inexpensive, one-dimensional vermouths; the quality of this ingredient is just as important as the whiskey.

##### **Primary Recommendation: Carpano Antica Formula**

* **Analysis**: Widely regarded as the gold standard for a rich, bold Manhattan.95 Its recipe dates to 1786 and it boasts a powerful and complex profile dominated by notes of vanilla, cocoa, bitter orange, and saffron. It creates a decadent, full-bodied Manhattan where the vermouth is a prominent and celebrated component.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in major supermarkets and specialist retailers. A 1L bottle is typically £30-£33.

##### **Secondary Recommendation: Cocchi Storico Vermouth di Torino**

* **Analysis**: Another top-tier Italian vermouth that is a favourite of many craft bartenders.95 It is slightly less vanilla-forward and perhaps more balanced than Carpano Antica, with vibrant notes of cocoa, citrus, and rhubarb. It creates a sophisticated and beautifully integrated Manhattan.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available from specialist retailers and some larger supermarkets like Waitrose. A 75cl bottle is typically £25-£28.

##### **Accessible Choice: Dolin Rouge**

* **Analysis**: A French vermouth from Chambéry that offers a lighter, more floral, and less intensely sweet profile than its Italian counterparts.96 It is an excellent and versatile sweet vermouth that allows the whiskey to remain the star of the show, creating a more delicate but still delicious Manhattan.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available from specialist retailers and larger supermarkets. A 75cl bottle is typically £14-£17.

#### **Ingredient: Angostura Bitters**

* **Analysis**: Angostura Aromatic Bitters is the classic, non-negotiable choice. Its unique and secret blend of herbs and spices provides the essential binding element and aromatic complexity that defines the cocktail.99

### **Margarita**

The Margarita is one of the world's most popular cocktails, a perfect sour that balances the earthy, vegetal notes of tequila with the bright sweetness of orange liqueur and the sharp tang of fresh lime juice. A true Margarita is always made with 100% agave tequila and is shaken and served on the rocks or straight up, a world away from the frozen, overly sweet versions often found.

#### **Ingredient: Tequila 100% Agave**

##### **Profile Requirements**

For a classic Margarita, a blanco (also known as silver or plata) tequila is the ideal choice. Unaged and bottled shortly after distillation, it offers the purest expression of the blue weber agave, with clean, crisp notes of citrus, pepper, and earth that shine in the cocktail.102

##### **Primary Recommendation: LALO Blanco Tequila**

* **Analysis**: A relative newcomer that has quickly become a top choice among mixology experts for its exceptional purity and flavour.103 LALO is an additive-free tequila made with only agave, yeast, and water. It has a bright, citrus-dominant profile with subtle spice notes that are perfectly suited to enhance and balance a Margarita without overpowering it.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Availability in the UK is growing but it is primarily found through specialist online retailers. A 70cl bottle is typically priced around £40-£78 depending on the importer.104

##### **Secondary Recommendation: Fortaleza Blanco**

* **Analysis**: A cult-favourite, artisanal tequila made using traditional methods, including cooking agave in stone ovens and crushing it with a volcanic stone tahona wheel.102 The result is an incredibly smooth, complex tequila with rich cooked agave, citrus, and olive brine notes that creates a truly exceptional, premium Margarita.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Highly sought after and often allocated, Fortaleza is available through specialist UK retailers. Expect to pay a premium, typically £70-£85 for a 70cl bottle.109

##### **Accessible Choice: Espolòn Blanco**

* **Analysis**: A crowd-pleasing and widely respected 100% agave tequila that offers fantastic value.45 It has a well-balanced profile with clean agave, tropical fruit, and pepper notes, making it a reliable and excellent choice for mixing large batches of high-quality Margaritas.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available in some larger supermarkets and widely available from specialist retailers. The price is typically £33-£35 for a 70cl bottle.114

##### **Bartender's Budget Choice: Cimarron Blanco**

* **Analysis**: A favourite among bartenders for its quality-to-price ratio.102 It is an additive-free, bright, agave-forward tequila that is perfect for high-volume mixing without sacrificing quality.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Primarily available through specialist bar suppliers and online retailers in the UK. A 1L bottle often represents excellent value.

#### **Ingredient: Triple Sec**

* **Analysis**: As with the Lemon Drop Martini, the choice of orange liqueur is critical. The user's list specifies "Triple Sec," but for a superior Margarita, a high-quality, drier style is essential.  
* **Primary Recommendation: Cointreau**. This is the gold standard for a classic Margarita, providing the perfect balance of sweet and bitter orange with a clean finish that allows the tequila to shine.102  
* **Alternative: Pierre Ferrand Dry Curaçao**. For a slightly different but equally delicious profile, this brandy-based curaçao adds notes of spice and vanilla that create a richer, more complex Margarita.

### **Martinez**

The Martinez is a fascinating and delicious piece of cocktail history, widely considered to be the evolutionary link between the Manhattan and the modern Dry Martini. It is a sweeter, more aromatic precursor to the Martini, blending gin (originally Old Tom, but London Dry works beautifully) with sweet vermouth, a touch of maraschino liqueur, and orange bitters.

#### **Ingredient: London Dry Gin**

* **Analysis**: While Old Tom gin is the historical base, a classic London Dry creates a crisper, more contemporary version of the Martinez. The gin needs to have a solid botanical character to balance the sweetness of the vermouth and maraschino.  
* **Recommendations: Hayman's London Dry Gin** or **Sipsmith London Dry Gin**. Hayman's is a classic, family-distilled gin that is frequently recommended for vintage cocktails.119 Sipsmith offers a bright, well-balanced profile that works exceptionally well in this recipe.120

#### **Ingredient: Sweet Red Vermouth**

* **Analysis**: The choice of vermouth is key to the cocktail's character. A high-quality Italian or French vermouth is required.  
* **Primary Recommendation: Cocchi Storico Vermouth di Torino**. Its balanced profile of fruit, spice, and bitterness makes it an ideal partner for the gin and maraschino.97  
* **Secondary Recommendation: Dolin Rouge**. A lighter, French-style vermouth that will create a more delicate Martinez, allowing more of the gin's botanicals to come through.98

#### **Ingredient: Maraschino Liqueur (Luxardo)**

* **Confirmation of Standard**: The user's specification of Luxardo Maraschino is the correct and classic choice. Just a bar spoon is needed to add its unique dry, nutty complexity, which is a defining feature of the drink.97

#### **Ingredient: Orange Bitters**

* **Analysis**: Orange bitters are essential for adding aromatic lift and a final layer of citrus complexity.  
* **Recommendations: Angostura Orange Bitters** or **Regan's Orange Bitters No. 6**. Both are excellent, classic choices that will perform perfectly in this cocktail.121

### **Mary Pickford**

Named after the silent film star, the Mary Pickford is a classic Prohibition-era cocktail created in Cuba in the 1920s.122 It's a beautifully simple and refreshing drink that combines white rum, fresh pineapple juice, grenadine, and a touch of maraschino liqueur, resulting in a pretty, pale pink tipple with a tropical character.

#### **Ingredient: White Rum**

* **Analysis**: The original was likely made with Bacardi, the ubiquitous Cuban rum of the era.122 A light, clean, column-distilled white rum is the standard. However, using a more flavourful white rum with some character from pot-still components can elevate the drink significantly.  
* **Primary Recommendation: Probitas White Blended Rum** (sold as Veritas in the UK). A collaboration between Foursquare in Barbados and Hampden Estate in Jamaica, this rum is a bartender favourite. It is a blend of pot and column still rums, offering more flavour and complexity than standard white rums, which adds wonderful depth to the Mary Pickford.122 Availability in the UK is limited to specialist retailers.125  
* **Accessible Choice: Plantation 3 Stars**. A blend of rums from Barbados, Jamaica, and Trinidad, this is another step-up from standard white rums, offering subtle notes of tropical fruit and brown sugar that complement the pineapple juice beautifully.122 Available in many UK supermarkets and specialist shops.  
* **Classic Choice: Bacardi Superior Carta Blanca**. For an authentic taste of the original, Bacardi provides the clean, light profile the drink was built on.123

#### **Ingredient: Maraschino Liqueur (Luxardo)**

* **Confirmation of Standard**: The user has correctly specified Luxardo. Only a small amount is needed, but its unique, funky, nutty character is essential to give the drink its classic profile and prevent it from being a simple mix of rum and pineapple.122

#### **Ingredient: Grenadine Syrup**

* **Analysis**: Grenadine's primary role here is for colour, lending the drink its signature pink hue, but a quality syrup will also add a touch of pomegranate fruit complexity.123 Avoid artificially flavoured bright red syrups.  
* **Recommendations**: UK-based brands like **Bristol Syrup Company** make excellent, authentic grenadine from real pomegranate.130  
  **Monin** and **Teisseire** are widely available and reliable alternatives that use real fruit juice.123

### **Mimosa**

The Mimosa is the quintessential brunch cocktail, a simple and elegant combination of sparkling wine and fresh orange juice. Its beauty lies in its simplicity, but the quality of the two ingredients is paramount to its success.

#### **Ingredient: Prosecco**

* **Analysis**: While the original cocktail may have used Champagne, Prosecco has become the modern standard for its bright, fruity character and excellent value. The key is to choose a "Brut" style, which is dry and has low residual sugar. Using a sweeter "Extra Dry" or "Dry" Prosecco will result in a cloyingly sweet cocktail when mixed with orange juice.132  
* **Primary Recommendation: La Marca Prosecco DOC**. A highly versatile and widely praised Prosecco, noted for its vibrant bouquet of citrus and white flowers and a clean, fresh palate of green apple and grapefruit. Its crispness is a perfect foil for the sweetness of orange juice.132  
* **Secondary Recommendation: Mionetto Prosecco di Treviso Brut**. Another excellent and widely available Brut Prosecco. It is dry and clean, with fresh notes of golden pear and honey that pair beautifully in a Mimosa.132  
* **Accessible Choice: Zonin Cuvée 1821 Prosecco Spumante Brut**. A reliable and affordable choice that delivers the necessary crisp acidity and fruity notes of apple and wisteria to create a refreshing Mimosa.132

### **Mint Julep**

The official drink of the Kentucky Derby, the Mint Julep is a venerable and iconic American cocktail. It is a simple but exacting mixture of bourbon, fresh mint, sugar, and crushed ice, served in its signature metal julep cup. The choice of bourbon is crucial, as it is the dominant flavour. A higher-proof bourbon (at least 45% ABV) is recommended to stand up to the significant dilution from the crushed ice.135

#### **Ingredient: Bourbon Whiskey**

##### **Profile Requirements**

A classic Kentucky straight bourbon with a good balance of corn sweetness, rye spice, and oak character is ideal. The vanilla and caramel notes inherent in bourbon are a perfect match for the fresh mint.

##### **Primary Recommendation: Woodford Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon**

* **Analysis**: Often considered the quintessential bourbon for a Mint Julep, and it is the official bourbon of the Kentucky Derby.135 It has a perfectly balanced and complex profile with notes of dried fruit, vanilla, toffee, and spice, with a smooth and creamy finish that makes for an exceptionally refined Julep.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in all major UK supermarkets. The price is typically £35-£40 for a 70cl bottle, though often on offer for less.136

##### **Secondary Recommendation: Wild Turkey 101**

* **Analysis**: A bold, high-proof (50.5% ABV) bourbon that is a favourite among enthusiasts for cocktails that require a strong whiskey backbone.135 Its high rye content provides a spicy kick that beautifully complements the mint and sugar, and its high proof ensures the bourbon flavour is not lost to dilution.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in UK supermarkets like Tesco and Sainsbury's. The price is typically £35-£36, but frequently on offer for around £25, representing outstanding value.140

##### **Accessible Choice: Buffalo Trace Kentucky Straight Bourbon**

* **Analysis**: An excellent all-rounder and a fantastic value bourbon. It has a classic profile of caramel, vanilla, and a hint of spice, making it a smooth and very well-balanced choice for a Mint Julep.139  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available in most major supermarkets, though its popularity can lead to intermittent stock issues. The price is typically £25-£27 for a 70cl bottle.

##### **Enthusiast's Choice: Four Roses Small Batch**

* **Analysis**: Praised for its unique profile derived from blending four different bourbon recipes. It offers a mellow, balanced flavour with notes of ripe fruit, gentle spice, and sweet oak that is described by some as being "like it was made for" a Mint Julep.135  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available from specialist retailers and some larger supermarkets. The price is typically £33-£39 for a 70cl bottle.145

### **Missionary's Downfall**

A classic Tiki cocktail created by the legendary Donn Beach (of Don the Beachcomber fame) in the 1940s.149 It is a wonderfully refreshing blended drink that combines white rum, peach brandy, pineapple, lime, honey, and a generous amount of fresh mint. It is often described as a more complex, tropical cousin to the Mojito.

#### **Ingredient: White Rum**

* **Analysis**: The recipe calls for a light or white rum. As with many Tiki drinks, a rum with some character will produce a more flavourful result than a completely neutral one.  
* **Primary Recommendation: Plantation 3 Stars**. This is an excellent and accessible white rum that is a blend from three Caribbean islands. It has more character than standard white rums, with notes of tropical fruit and a hint of spice that work perfectly in this drink.150  
* **Classic Choice: Bacardi Superior Carta Blanca**. A clean, light, and dry rum that provides the classic profile for this style of drink, allowing the fruit and mint to be the primary flavours.151

#### **Ingredient: Peach Brandy**

* **Analysis**: The original recipe calls for peach brandy (a spirit distilled from fermented peaches), but many modern recipes substitute a high-quality peach liqueur for a cleaner, more consistent flavour.149  
* **Primary Recommendation (Liqueur): Giffard Crème de Pêche de Vigne**. A superb French peach liqueur made from an infusion of vine peaches. It has an authentic, vibrant, and fresh peach flavour that is highly recommended by mixologists.150  
* **Accessible Choice (Liqueur): DeKuyper Peach Schnapps**. While "schnapps" can often imply an artificial flavour, DeKuyper is a reliable brand, and its peach liqueur is a widely available and acceptable substitute.149

### **Mojito**

The iconic highball from Cuba, the Mojito is a globally beloved cocktail celebrated for its supremely refreshing character. A perfect Mojito is a delicate balance of white Cuban-style rum, fresh lime juice, mint, sugar, and soda water. The key is to gently muddle the mint to release its essential oils without shredding it, which can release bitter chlorophyll.

#### **Ingredient: White Cuban Ron (Rum)**

##### **Profile Requirements**

The traditional choice is a light, crisp, and clean Cuban or Spanish-style white rum (ron). This style, typically column-distilled from molasses and lightly aged before being charcoal filtered, provides a smooth and subtle base that allows the fresh mint and lime to shine.

##### **Primary Recommendation: Havana Club Añejo 3 Años**

* **Analysis**: This is the quintessential rum for an authentic Cuban Mojito.158 Aged for three years, it has a pale straw colour and a flavour profile that is more complex than unaged white rums, with notes of vanilla, oak, and fruit that add depth to the cocktail while remaining light and fresh. It is the go-to for cocktail lovers seeking the genuine article.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in UK supermarkets and specialist retailers. The price is typically £20-£23 for a 70cl bottle.

##### **Secondary Recommendation: Plantation 3 Stars**

* **Analysis**: An excellent alternative that provides a bit more complexity. It is a blend of rums from Trinidad, Barbados, and Jamaica, offering subtle notes of tropical fruit, brown sugar, and vanilla that create a very flavourful Mojito.159  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available in many UK supermarkets and specialist retailers. The price is typically £25-£28 for a 70cl bottle.

##### **Accessible Choice: Bacardi Superior Carta Blanca**

* **Analysis**: While technically produced in Puerto Rico today, Bacardi's origins are Cuban, and it embodies the light, crisp style required for a classic Mojito. It is widely available, affordable, and a crowd-pleasing choice that delivers a clean and refreshing drink.158  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Ubiquitous. The price is typically £18-£21 for a 70cl bottle.

### **Monkey Gland**

A classic cocktail with a provocative name, the Monkey Gland was created by Harry MacElhone at his legendary Harry's New York Bar in Paris in the 1920s.161 The name refers to a dubious surgical procedure of the era. The drink itself, however, is a delicious and well-balanced combination of dry gin, fresh orange juice, grenadine, and a crucial dash or rinse of absinthe.

#### **Ingredient: Dry Gin**

* **Analysis**: The recipe calls for a classic dry gin. A London Dry style is perfect, providing the juniper and botanical structure to balance the sweet and fruity elements. Some early recipes suggest Plymouth gin, which would create a slightly softer version.162  
* **Primary Recommendation: Beefeater London Dry Gin**. A classic, juniper-forward London Dry that is a perfect, no-nonsense choice for this cocktail. Its robust character stands up well to the orange and absinthe.163  
* **Secondary Recommendation: Hayman's London Dry Gin**. A traditional, family-distilled gin that is often recommended for classic cocktails due to its balanced and elegant botanical profile.161

#### **Ingredient: Absinthe**

* **Analysis**: The absinthe is used in a very small quantity (a "dash" or a rinse of the glass), but its contribution is essential, adding a complex, herbal, anise aroma and flavour that ties the drink together.164 A traditional French or Swiss-style  
  *verte* absinthe is ideal.  
* **Primary Recommendation: La Fée Parisienne Absinthe**. A classic and widely available French absinthe that is distilled with grand wormwood and other traditional botanicals. It is a benchmark product perfect for use in cocktails.161  
* **UK-Crafted Recommendation: Green Man Absinthe**. An authentic, small-batch absinthe from Hertfordshire, distilled to a historic recipe with foraged botanicals. At 70% ABV, it is a high-quality, uncompromisingly authentic choice for the enthusiast.168

### **Moscow Mule**

The Moscow Mule is a modern classic, created in the 1940s as a marketing collaboration to promote Smirnoff vodka and Cock 'n' Bull ginger beer.169 It is a simple, effervescent, and supremely refreshing highball made with vodka, spicy ginger beer, and fresh lime juice, famously served in a copper mug.

#### **Ingredient: Smirnoff Vodka**

##### **Confirmation of Standard**

The user has correctly specified Smirnoff vodka, which is the historically accurate and original spirit for the Moscow Mule.170 Its clean, neutral profile makes it the perfect canvas for the assertive flavours of ginger and lime. For an authentic experience, Smirnoff No. 21 is the correct and most appropriate choice.

##### **Notable Alternatives**

While Smirnoff is the original, the simplicity of the drink means that any good quality, clean vodka will work well. The choice of vodka is less critical than the choice of ginger beer.

* **Premium Alternative: Ketel One**. For those who prefer a smoother, more premium base, Ketel One's crisp character is an excellent fit.34  
* **Value Alternative: Russian Standard**. A well-regarded Russian vodka that offers a very clean profile at an accessible price point, making it a popular choice for mixing.170

#### **Ingredient: Ginger Beer**

##### **Profile Requirements**

The ginger beer is the heart and soul of a Moscow Mule. It should be spicy and robust, with a pronounced ginger flavour, rather than being overly sweet like a ginger ale. The level of spice and sweetness is a matter of personal preference, and there is a wide range of excellent options available.

##### **Primary Recommendation: Fever-Tree Premium Ginger Beer**

* **Analysis**: A top choice among bartenders and consumers, Fever-Tree is renowned for its quality. It is made by blending three different types of ginger from Nigeria, Cochin, and the Ivory Coast, resulting in a deep, long-lasting ginger character that is spicy but not overwhelmingly sweet.169  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in all major UK supermarkets. A 500ml bottle is typically £2-£2.35.

##### **Secondary Recommendation: Bundaberg Ginger Beer**

* **Analysis**: An Australian classic, this ginger beer is brewed and has a very balanced profile. It is sweet but not cloying, with a peppery ginger kick that is very pleasant and makes for a crowd-pleasing Moscow Mule.169  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in UK supermarkets. A 4x375ml pack is typically around £4.50-£5.00.

##### **Spicier Choice: Fentimans Ginger Beer**

* **Analysis**: A botanically brewed ginger beer from the UK, Fentimans uses fermented Chinese ginger root to create a product with a fiery and complex ginger flavour.169 This is an excellent choice for those who prefer their Mule with a significant spicy bite.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available in many major supermarkets and specialist food shops. A 4x275ml pack is typically around £4.50-£5.00.

### **Naked and Famous**

A modern classic created by bartender Joaquín Simó in 2011, the Naked and Famous is a brilliant and complex equal-parts cocktail. It is often described as a cross between a Last Word and a Paper Plane, combining smoky mezcal, yellow Chartreuse, Aperol, and fresh lime juice into a perfectly balanced drink that is smoky, bittersweet, herbal, and tart.175

#### **Ingredient: Mezcal**

##### **Profile Requirements**

The mezcal provides the smoky backbone of the drink. A high-quality, 100% agave mezcal is essential. The original recipe calls for a specific expression, but a good quality *espadín* mezcal with a balanced level of smoke is the general recommendation.

##### **Primary Recommendation: Del Maguey Vida Clásico Mezcal**

* **Analysis**: This is the benchmark for a high-quality, accessible, and versatile mezcal for cocktails. It has a balanced profile of fruit, honey, and vanilla with a distinct but not overpowering smokiness and a spicy finish. It is frequently recommended for this cocktail and is an excellent introduction to the spirit.175  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available from specialist retailers like The Whisky Exchange. The price is typically £45-£48 for a 70cl bottle.175

##### **The Original's Choice: Del Maguey Chichicapa**

* **Analysis**: Joaquín Simó's original recipe specifically calls for Del Maguey Chichicapa.175 This is a single-village mezcal that is more complex and less smoky than Vida, with a smoother, more citrus-forward profile. It creates a more nuanced and refined version of the cocktail for the serious enthusiast.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available from specialist retailers. It is a premium product, typically priced at £75-£85 for a 70cl bottle.

#### **Ingredient: Yellow Chartreuse**

* **Analysis**: The sweeter, milder, and more honeyed sibling of Green Chartreuse, the yellow version (43% ABV) is essential here. Its floral and saffron notes are a perfect match for the smoky mezcal and bitter Aperol.175  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Like its green counterpart, it can be subject to shortages. It is available from specialist UK retailers like The Whisky Exchange and Spirit Store. The price is typically £45-£50 for a 70cl bottle.179

#### **Ingredient: Aperol**

* **Analysis**: This Italian bittersweet orange aperitivo provides the cocktail's bitter component and vibrant colour. Its lighter, less bitter profile compared to Campari is crucial for the drink's balance.175 Aperol is a proprietary product with no direct substitutes.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Ubiquitous in all UK supermarkets. The price is typically £15-£17 for a 70cl bottle.

### **Negroni**

An icon of Italian aperitivo culture, the Negroni is a cocktail of profound simplicity and perfect balance. Created in Florence around 1919, it is an equal-parts combination of gin, Campari, and sweet red vermouth. The interplay of the gin's botanicals, Campari's assertive bitterness, and the vermouth's rich sweetness creates a drink that is at once complex, refreshing, and deeply satisfying.

#### **Ingredient: Gin**

##### **Profile Requirements**

The gin must be bold and juniper-forward to hold its own against the two other powerful ingredients. A classic London Dry style is the undisputed traditional choice. A gin with strong citrus notes can also work beautifully, complementing the orange profile of the Campari and the traditional garnish.184

##### **Primary Recommendation: Beefeater London Dry Gin**

* **Analysis**: The overwhelming top choice among bartenders for a classic, no-nonsense Negroni.184 Its strong juniper character, balanced by notes of Seville orange and lemon peel, is the perfect botanical counterpoint to Campari and sweet vermouth. It is affordable, accessible, and represents the benchmark for a traditional Negroni.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in all UK supermarkets. The price is typically £18-£21 for a 70cl bottle.13

##### **Secondary Recommendation: Tanqueray No. 10**

* **Analysis**: For a Negroni with a brighter, more citrus-forward character, Tanqueray No. 10 is an exceptional choice. Distilled with fresh citrus fruits including grapefruit and lime, it adds a zesty lift to the cocktail that beautifully complements the orange notes in the Campari and garnish.184  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available in most major supermarkets and specialist retailers. The price is typically £32-£35 for a 70cl bottle.

##### **Artisanal Choice: Four Pillars Spiced Negroni Gin**

* **Analysis**: A gin specifically designed by its Australian distillers to create the ultimate Negroni. It is distilled with botanicals like Tasmanian pepperberry, cinnamon, and ginger, which add a layer of exotic spice that harmonises perfectly with the other ingredients, creating a uniquely complex and flavourful drink.184  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available from specialist UK retailers like The Whisky Exchange. It is a premium product, typically priced around £40 for a 70cl bottle.

#### **Ingredient: Bitter Campari**

##### **The Standard & Notable Alternatives**

Campari is the defining, non-negotiable ingredient of a Negroni. Its unique, intensely bitter, and complex flavour profile of bitter orange, herbs, and rhubarb is irreplaceable. While other Italian red bitter aperitivos exist, they are not substitutes but rather create different cocktails entirely.188

* **For Experimentation**: For those who wish to explore variations, **Aperol** will create a much sweeter, less bitter drink.190  
  **Cappelletti Aperitivo Americano Rosso** is wine-based and offers a lighter, fruitier bitterness.188  
  **Luxardo Bitter** is drier and more robust, with prominent rhubarb and marjoram notes.188

#### **Ingredient: Sweet Red Vermouth**

##### **Profile Requirements**

The vermouth must be rich and complex enough to stand alongside the gin and Campari, providing sweetness and herbal depth. A high-quality Italian vermouth di Torino is the classic choice.

##### **Primary Recommendation: Cocchi Storico Vermouth di Torino**

* **Analysis**: The top recommendation from a consensus of bartenders for a perfectly balanced Negroni.192 It has a vibrant profile with notes of cocoa, citrus, rhubarb, and spice that integrate seamlessly with Campari and juniper-forward gin, without the heavy vanilla notes of some other vermouths.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available from specialist retailers and some larger supermarkets. A 75cl bottle is typically £25-£28.

##### **Secondary Recommendation: Carpano Antica Formula**

* **Analysis**: A fantastic choice for a richer, more decadent Negroni. Its bold profile of vanilla, dried fruit, and saffron creates a more luxurious and vermouth-forward cocktail.193 Some find its vanilla notes can be slightly overpowering, but for many, it is the ultimate choice.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in major supermarkets and specialist retailers. A 1L bottle is typically £30-£33.

### **New York Sour**

The New York Sour is an elegant and visually stunning variation on the classic Whiskey Sour. It follows the standard recipe of whiskey, lemon juice, and simple syrup (often with egg white for texture), but with the addition of a float of dry red wine on top, which creates a beautiful layered effect and adds notes of dark fruit and tannin to the finished drink.

#### **Ingredient: Rye Whiskey or Bourbon**

##### **Profile Requirements**

The choice between rye and bourbon defines the character of the sour. Bourbon, with its corn-based sweetness and notes of caramel and vanilla, creates a softer, rounder, and more approachable sour.195 Rye, with its characteristic spice and peppery notes, creates a drink with more bite and complexity that stands up well to the addition of the red wine.197 Both are excellent choices.

##### **Primary Recommendation (Rye): Rittenhouse Straight Rye Whisky Bottled-in-Bond**

* **Analysis**: An excellent choice for a New York Sour. Its 100-proof strength ensures it isn't lost in the mix, and its balanced profile of spice and sweetness provides a perfect base for the lemon and wine.199  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available from specialist UK retailers. The price is typically £41-£49 for a 70cl bottle.82

##### **Primary Recommendation (Bourbon): Buffalo Trace**

* **Analysis**: A top recommendation for a classic Whiskey Sour due to its well-balanced profile of caramel sweetness, soft spice, and smooth finish.196 It creates a delicious and approachable New York Sour where the bourbon and wine complement each other beautifully.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available in most major supermarkets. The price is typically £25-£27 for a 70cl bottle.

##### **Secondary Recommendation (Bourbon): Woodford Reserve**

* **Analysis**: With a higher rye content than many bourbons, Woodford Reserve offers a more complex and layered experience, with notes of dried fruit, spice, and toasted oak that pair wonderfully with a full-bodied red wine.196  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in all major UK supermarkets. The price is typically £35-£40 for a 70cl bottle.136

#### **Ingredient: Red Wine (Shiraz or Malbec)**

##### **Profile Requirements**

The wine for the float should be dry, fruity, and full-bodied. It needs enough character to stand on its own as the final flavour component of the drink. Wines with good fruit character and not overly aggressive tannins work best.

##### **Primary Recommendation: A fruity Australian Shiraz**

* **Analysis**: A new-world Shiraz is often recommended for its bold, juicy fruit flavours (blackberry, plum) and peppery spice notes, which complement the whiskey base perfectly.201 Brands like  
  **19 Crimes Cabernet Sauvignon** (often behaving like a rich Shiraz blend) or other accessible Australian labels are excellent choices.203  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in all supermarkets. Price range: £8-£12.

##### **Secondary Recommendation: An Argentinian Malbec**

* **Analysis**: Malbec is another excellent choice, known for its plush dark fruit flavours (blackberry, black cherry) and smooth texture.204 It creates a rich and velvety float.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in all supermarkets. Price range: £8-£12.

### **Old Cuban**

A modern classic created by the legendary bartender Audrey Saunders of New York's Pegu Club, the Old Cuban is a sophisticated and celebratory cocktail. It can be thought of as an upscale Mojito, splitting the difference with a French 75; it uses aged rum, fresh mint, lime, and bitters, but tops it with Champagne instead of soda water, creating a rich, complex, and effervescent drink.205

#### **Ingredient: Aged Rum**

##### **Profile Requirements**

The recipe calls for a quality aged rum (añejo) with enough complexity and depth to stand up to the Champagne. A rum with notes of caramel, vanilla, and subtle spice from oak aging is ideal. Overly funky Jamaican rums or very sweet, dosed rums are generally avoided in favour of a more elegant, balanced profile.207

##### **Primary Recommendation: Bacardi Reserva Ocho (8 Años)**

* **Analysis**: This was the specific rum used in Audrey Saunders' original recipe and remains the benchmark for the authentic Old Cuban flavour.207 It is a beautifully smooth and mellow rum with notes of oak, vanilla, dried apricot, and gentle spice that integrate seamlessly with the mint and sparkling wine.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available in many major supermarkets and specialist retailers. The price is typically £34-£42 for a 70cl bottle.208

##### **Secondary Recommendation: Plantation 5 Year Grande Réserve**

* **Analysis**: A well-balanced and versatile rum from Barbados, aged in bourbon casks. It offers slightly richer notes of tropical fruit, toasted coconut, and baking spice, creating a bolder but equally delicious Old Cuban.207  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in UK supermarkets and specialist retailers. The price is typically £33-£37 for a 70cl bottle.

##### **Alternative Recommendation: Flor de Caña 7 Gran Reserva**

* **Analysis**: A drier, leaner style of aged rum from Nicaragua. It has prominent notes of toffee, toasted nuts, and cocoa, which pair beautifully with a crisp brut sparkling wine and fresh lime.207  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available in many major supermarkets and specialist retailers. The price is typically £29-£33 for a 70cl bottle.

#### **Ingredient: Brut Champagne or Prosecco**

##### **Profile Requirements**

A dry sparkling wine is essential to provide effervescence and acidity without adding excess sweetness. The term "Brut" indicates a dry style. While Champagne adds a luxurious brioche note, a high-quality Prosecco or Cava works exceptionally well and is more economical.223

##### **Primary Recommendation: A quality Brut Cava**

* **Analysis**: Spanish Cava, made in the same traditional method as Champagne, offers excellent quality and value. It typically has fine bubbles and crisp notes of green apple and citrus that are perfect for the Old Cuban.223 Brands like  
  **Freixenet Cordon Negro Brut** are widely available and reliable.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in supermarkets. Price range: £10-£14.

##### **Secondary Recommendation: A quality Brut Prosecco**

* **Analysis**: Prosecco will lend a fruitier, more floral character to the drink. It is crucial to select a "Brut" version to ensure it is dry enough.225 See Mimosa recommendations for specific brands like  
  **La Marca** or **Mionetto**.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in supermarkets. Price range: £10-£15.

### **Old Fashioned**

The Old Fashioned is not merely a cocktail; it is the archetypal cocktail, a timeless and elemental combination of spirit, sugar, water, and bitters. Its beauty lies in its simplicity, which allows the quality of the base whiskey to take centre stage. The choice between bourbon and rye is a matter of personal preference, defining the drink's fundamental character.

#### **Ingredient: Bourbon or Rye Whiskey**

##### **Profile Requirements**

The whiskey must be of high quality and robust enough to be the star. A higher proof (45-50% ABV) is generally preferred as it stands up better to the sugar, bitters, and dilution. Bourbon will create a sweeter, richer Old Fashioned with notes of caramel and vanilla. Rye will produce a spicier, drier, and more complex version.81

##### **Primary Recommendation (Bourbon): Russell's Reserve 10 Year**

* **Analysis**: An exceptional choice for an Old Fashioned, crafted by legendary distillers Jimmy and Eddie Russell. It offers a perfect balance of rich caramel, vanilla, and toffee with a significant spice character from the oak and rye in the mash bill. At 45% ABV, it has the ideal weight and complexity for the drink.90  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available from specialist UK retailers. The price is typically £45-£55 for a 70cl bottle.

##### **Primary Recommendation (Rye): Rittenhouse Straight Rye Bottled-in-Bond**

* **Analysis**: A bartender favourite for a rye Old Fashioned. Its 100-proof strength provides a bold base, while its flavour profile perfectly balances peppery rye spice with the underlying sweetness of a Kentucky-style rye, making it a fantastic and versatile choice.81  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available from specialist UK retailers. The price is typically £41-£49 for a 70cl bottle.82

##### **Accessible Choice (Bourbon): Wild Turkey 101**

* **Analysis**: A high-proof, high-rye bourbon that offers outstanding value and makes a bold, spicy, and flavourful Old Fashioned. It is a workhorse spirit that never fails to deliver in classic cocktails.199  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in UK supermarkets. The price is typically £35-£36, but often on offer for around £25.140

##### **Premium Choice (Rye): WhistlePig Piggyback Rye**

* **Analysis**: A 100% rye whiskey specifically created for mixing. At 96.56 proof, it delivers a powerful punch of spice, black pepper, and citrus that creates an incredibly flavourful and robust Old Fashioned.90  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available from specialist retailers. The price is typically £45-£50 for a 70cl bottle.

#### **Ingredient: Angostura Bitters**

* **Analysis**: The classic and essential choice. Two to three dashes of Angostura Aromatic Bitters are fundamental to the Old Fashioned's flavour profile, adding layers of spice, clove, and cinnamon that bind the whiskey and sugar together.100  
* **For Experimentation**: While Angostura is the standard, the Old Fashioned is a perfect canvas for experimenting with other bitters. **Regan's Orange Bitters No. 6** adds a zesty lift, while walnut bitters, such as **Fee Brothers Black Walnut Bitters**, introduce a rich, nutty complexity that pairs beautifully with aged spirits.231

### **Paloma**

The Paloma is Mexico's most popular tequila-based cocktail, a simple and incredibly refreshing highball that is a perfect showcase for good tequila. The classic recipe combines 100% agave tequila and grapefruit soda with a squeeze of fresh lime and a pinch of salt. It is the balance of earthy tequila, sweet-tart grapefruit, and savoury salt that makes this drink so compelling.

#### **Ingredient: 100% Agave Tequila**

##### **Profile Requirements**

A high-quality blanco tequila is the classic choice, its crisp, peppery, and citrusy agave notes providing the perfect counterpoint to the grapefruit soda.233 A reposado tequila, which is lightly aged in oak, can also be used for a slightly smoother, richer Paloma with notes of vanilla and caramel.108

##### **Primary Recommendation (Blanco): Espolòn Blanco**

* **Analysis**: A fantastic and widely available 100% agave tequila that is a go-to for many bartenders. Its clean profile, with notes of sweet agave, tropical fruit, and a hint of pepper, is perfectly suited for a Paloma, allowing the grapefruit to shine while providing a solid, flavourful base.108  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available in some larger supermarkets and widely from specialist retailers. The price is typically £33-£35 for a 70cl bottle.114

##### **Primary Recommendation (Reposado): Patrón Reposado**

* **Analysis**: Patrón is a globally recognised premium brand, and its Reposado is an excellent choice for a more refined Paloma. Aged in oak for over two months, it has a smooth character with notes of oak, vanilla, and fresh citrus that beautifully complement the grapefruit soda.108  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in UK supermarkets and specialist retailers. The price is typically £50-£55 for a 70cl bottle.

##### **Accessible Choice (Blanco): El Jimador Silver**

* **Analysis**: A reliable and affordable 100% agave tequila that is perfect for mixing. It has a fresh, crisp, and citrus-forward flavour that makes a classic and refreshing Paloma without breaking the bank.113  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in UK supermarkets like Sainsbury's. The price is typically £22-£26 for a 70cl bottle.235

#### **Ingredient: Pink Grapefruit Soda**

##### **Profile Requirements**

The choice of soda is crucial. The ideal soda is made with real grapefruit juice and cane sugar, offering a balance of sweetness and tartness. Traditional Mexican brands are often preferred.

##### **Primary Recommendation: Franklin & Sons Pink Grapefruit Soda**

* **Analysis**: A UK-based premium mixer brand that has won awards for its Pink Grapefruit Soda. It is praised for its excellent balance, natural citrusy bite, and fine carbonation, making it a top-tier choice for elevating a Paloma.238  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available in major supermarkets like Sainsbury's and Waitrose, and online. The price is typically around £2 for a 500ml bottle.

##### **Secondary Recommendation: Jarritos Grapefruit Soda**

* **Analysis**: A classic Mexican soda brand that is a favourite for authentic Palomas. It is made with cane sugar and has a fantastic, authentic grapefruit flavour. It can be harder to find but is worth seeking out.241  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available in some larger supermarkets with international food aisles, Mexican grocers, and online specialist retailers.

### **Paper Plane**

Created in 2008 by bartender Sam Ross (also of Penicillin fame), the Paper Plane is a modern classic that has achieved global popularity for its perfect balance of flavours. It is an equal-parts cocktail of bourbon, Amaro Nonino, Aperol, and fresh lemon juice. The result is a sophisticated sour that is simultaneously bitter, sweet, herbal, and tart.242

#### **Ingredient: Bourbon Whiskey**

##### **Profile Requirements**

The bourbon needs to have enough proof and character to stand up to the assertive flavours of the amaro and Aperol. A bourbon with a moderate proof (around 45% ABV) and a balanced profile of vanilla, caramel, and spice is ideal. Higher-proof bourbons (around 50% ABV) are also excellent, providing a more robust backbone.243

##### **Primary Recommendation: Woodford Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon**

* **Analysis**: A versatile and complex bourbon that works exceptionally well in a Paper Plane. Its rich profile of dried fruit, vanilla, and baking spice harmonises beautifully with the orange notes of the Aperol and the herbal character of the Amaro Nonino.243  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in all major UK supermarkets. The price is typically £35-£40 for a 70cl bottle.136

##### **Secondary Recommendation: Bulleit Bourbon**

* **Analysis**: Known for its high-rye mash bill, Bulleit offers a bolder, spicier character that provides a fantastic counterpoint to the sweet and bitter liqueurs in the Paper Plane.243 It is a bartender favourite for cocktails that require a robust whiskey base.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in UK supermarkets. The price is typically £30-£32 for a 70cl bottle.

##### **Accessible Choice: Maker's Mark**

* **Analysis**: As a wheated bourbon, Maker's Mark has a softer, sweeter profile with prominent notes of vanilla and caramel. It creates a smoother, less spicy Paper Plane that is very approachable and delicious.242  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in all UK supermarkets. The price is typically £31-£34 for a 70cl bottle.

#### **Ingredient: Amaro Nonino Quintessentia**

* **Analysis**: This is the specific, non-negotiable amaro for a true Paper Plane. Amaro Nonino is a unique, grappa-based amaro from Friuli, Italy. It has a fragrant, bittersweet profile with notes of orange, caramel, and gentle spice that is essential to the cocktail's unique flavour. While other amari can be substituted, they will create a different drink entirely.242  
* **UK Availability & Price**: This is a premium liqueur available from specialist UK retailers like The Whisky Exchange, Amathus Drinks, and Master of Malt. The price is typically £33-£35 for a 70cl bottle.245

#### **Ingredient: Aperol**

* **Analysis**: The ubiquitous Italian bitter aperitivo provides the drink's bitter orange notes and vibrant colour. Its lighter profile is key to the balance of the Paper Plane.242  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in all UK supermarkets. The price is typically £15-£17 for a 70cl bottle.

### **Paradise**

A classic cocktail from the early 20th century, the Paradise first appeared in Harry Craddock's 1930 *The Savoy Cocktail Book*.250 It is a simple, fruity, and refreshing gin sour, combining gin, apricot brandy, and fresh orange juice. Its beauty lies in its straightforward construction, which allows the quality of the ingredients to shine.

#### **Ingredient: Gin**

* **Analysis**: A classic London Dry gin is the perfect choice, providing a crisp, juniper-forward base that prevents the drink from becoming overly sweet and one-dimensional.163  
* **Primary Recommendation: Beefeater London Dry Gin**. Its balanced profile of juniper and citrus is a perfect match for the orange and apricot flavours.163  
* **Secondary Recommendation: Hayman's London Dry Gin**. A traditional and elegant gin that is often recommended for classic recipes, providing a smooth and well-rounded foundation.250

#### **Ingredient: Apricot Brandy**

* **Analysis**: This is the key flavouring component, so a high-quality liqueur is essential. The term "apricot brandy" is often used interchangeably with "apricot liqueur." The goal is a product with an authentic, rich apricot flavour, not an artificial or cloying sweetness.251  
* **Primary Recommendation: Giffard Abricot du Roussillon**. A highly regarded French liqueur made from an infusion of Roussillon apricots. It is prized by bartenders for its vibrant and authentic fruit flavour.251  
* **Secondary Recommendation: Rothman & Winter Orchard Apricot Liqueur**. An excellent Austrian liqueur known for its pure, intense apricot character and perfect balance of sweetness and acidity.251  
* **Accessible Choice: DeKuyper Apricot Brandy**. A widely available and affordable option that, while not as complex as the premium French or Austrian liqueurs, provides a pleasant and functional apricot flavour for mixing.251

### **Penicillin**

A modern masterpiece created by Sam Ross at New York's Milk & Honey bar in 2005, the Penicillin is a complex and deeply satisfying Scotch-based sour.254 It combines blended Scotch, fresh lemon juice, and a honey-ginger syrup, with a final, crucial float of smoky Islay single malt Scotch. The interplay of sweet honey, spicy ginger, tart lemon, and smoky peat makes it one of the most celebrated cocktails of the modern era.

#### **Ingredient: Blended Scotch Whisky**

##### **Profile Requirements**

The base of the drink requires a smooth, well-balanced blended Scotch. It should have enough character to be present but not so dominant that it clashes with the other powerful flavours. A blend with notes of honey, malt, and subtle fruit is ideal. Overly smoky or heavily sherried blends are generally avoided for the base.254

##### **Primary Recommendation: Monkey Shoulder Blended Malt Scotch Whisky**

* **Analysis**: A very popular choice and a bartender favourite for the Penicillin.254 It is a blend of Speyside single malts, known for its smooth, rich, and approachable profile with notes of vanilla, honey, and orange. It provides the perfect malty sweetness to support the ginger and lemon.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in all major UK supermarkets. The price is typically £30-£35 for a 70cl bottle.

##### **Secondary Recommendation: Dewar's 12 Year Old**

* **Analysis**: A classic blended Scotch that is praised for its smoothness and balance. It has a honeyed, fruity character with a hint of smoke that works beautifully in a Penicillin, as recommended by top London bars.255  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available in most major supermarkets and specialist retailers. The price is typically £30-£35 for a 70cl bottle.

##### **Accessible Choice: The Famous Grouse**

* **Analysis**: A versatile and accessible blended Scotch that provides a good balance of malt sweetness and a touch of oak, making it a solid and economical base for a Penicillin.254  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Ubiquitous in UK supermarkets. The price is typically £18-£20 for a 70cl bottle.

#### **Ingredient: Lagavulin 16 Year Old Islay Single Malt**

##### **Confirmation of Standard**

The user has correctly specified Lagavulin 16 Year as the float. This was the whisky used in Sam Ross's original recipe and is considered by many purists to be the definitive choice.255 Its rich, complex, and powerful peat smoke, combined with notes of sherry, seaweed, and fruit, provides an unforgettable aromatic and flavourful top note to the cocktail.

##### **Notable Alternatives**

While Lagavulin 16 is the classic, its rising price has led many to seek alternatives that provide the necessary smoky punch. The float requires a peated single malt from the Islay region.

* **Primary Alternative: Laphroaig 10 Year Old**. Known for its intense, medicinal, and iodine-like peat smoke, Laphroaig 10 provides a powerful and dramatic float that is a favourite in many bars.254 It is more affordable than Lagavulin 16\.  
* **Secondary Alternative: Ardbeg 10 Year Old**. Another excellent choice, Ardbeg 10 offers a highly peated profile that is balanced with notes of citrus and vanilla, creating a complex and smoky finish for the cocktail.254  
* **Budget-Friendly Alternative: Ardbeg Wee Beastie**. A younger, more aggressive expression from Ardbeg, this is a great value option for getting a powerful hit of peat and smoke into a cocktail without using a more expensive aged expression.257

### **Piña Colada**

The national drink of Puerto Rico, the Piña Colada is the ultimate tropical blended cocktail. A creamy and indulgent mix of rum, coconut cream, and pineapple juice, it evokes images of beaches and sunshine. A high-quality Piña Colada depends on using the right type of coconut product and a good rum.

#### **Ingredient: White Rum**

##### **Profile Requirements**

A light, white, or silver rum is the classic choice. It provides the alcoholic kick without overpowering the delicate balance of coconut and pineapple. A Spanish-style rum from Puerto Rico or Cuba is the traditional base.261

##### **Primary Recommendation: Plantation 3 Stars**

* **Analysis**: A bartender favourite for its versatility and flavour. This blend of rums from Barbados, Jamaica, and Trinidad offers more character than a standard neutral white rum, with subtle notes of tropical fruit and vanilla that enhance the cocktail's profile.263  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available in many UK supermarkets and specialist retailers. The price is typically £25-£28 for a 70cl bottle.

##### **Secondary Recommendation: Bacardi Superior Carta Blanca**

* **Analysis**: A classic and reliable choice that embodies the light, clean style perfect for a Piña Colada. Its subtle notes of almond and vanilla complement the other ingredients perfectly, creating a refreshing and traditional version of the drink.261  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Ubiquitous. The price is typically £18-£21 for a 70cl bottle.

##### **For a Bolder Drink: A Split Base**

* **Analysis**: For a more complex Piña Colada, many enthusiasts recommend a "split base," using both a white rum and a small amount of a richer, aged Jamaican rum like **Appleton Estate Signature Blend** or **Myers's Original Dark Rum**. This adds depth and notes of molasses and funk to the finished drink.261

#### **Ingredient: Coconut Cream**

##### **Profile Requirements**

This is the most critical ingredient for an authentic Piña Colada. It is essential to use "Cream of Coconut," which is a sweetened, processed product with a thick, syrupy consistency. This should not be confused with unsweetened "coconut cream" or "coconut milk," which are used for cooking. Using the wrong product will result in a disappointing drink.266

##### **Primary Recommendation: Coco Lopez Cream of Coconut**

* **Analysis**: Coco Lopez is the original and undisputed gold standard for Cream of Coconut. It was created in Puerto Rico in 1948 and was used in the first-ever Piña Colada. Its unique texture and perfect balance of coconut flavour and sweetness are considered essential for an authentic cocktail.265  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available in the "World Foods" aisle of most major UK supermarkets, as well as from online retailers like Amazon and specialist bar suppliers. A 425g tin is typically £2.50-£3.50.

### **Pisco Punch**

A legendary cocktail with roots in the San Francisco Gold Rush of the 19th century, the Pisco Punch is a deceptively potent and delicious drink. The original recipe was a closely guarded secret, but modern interpretations centre on a base of Peruvian pisco, fresh pineapple juice, and lemon juice. The user's recipe also includes cloves and dry white wine, adding layers of spice and acidity.

#### **Ingredient: Pisco**

##### **Profile Requirements**

Pisco is a type of brandy, or unaged grape spirit, produced in Peru and Chile. For a classic Pisco Punch or Pisco Sour, a Peruvian pisco is the traditional choice. There are several grape varietals used; a "Puro" is made from a single grape, while an "Acholado" is a blend. An aromatic varietal like Italia or an Acholado blend often works best in fruit-forward cocktails.272

##### **Primary Recommendation: BarSol Primero Quebranta**

* **Analysis**: BarSol is a highly respected and widely available brand of artisanal Peruvian pisco. Their Quebranta expression is a benchmark "Puro" style, offering a clean and smooth spirit with notes of pear, red apple, and hay. It is an excellent and versatile pisco for all classic cocktails.274 The brand's aromatic  
  **BarSol Mosto Verde Italia** is also highly recommended for this punch.273  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available from specialist UK retailers like The Whisky Exchange. The price for the Quebranta is typically £30-£35 for a 70cl bottle.

##### **Secondary Recommendation: Macchu Pisco**

* **Analysis**: Another excellent Peruvian pisco made from the Quebranta grape. It has a slightly earthier and grassier profile, with notes of lime peel and white pepper that work beautifully with the pineapple and lemon in the punch.274  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available from specialist UK retailers. The price is typically £35-£40 for a 70cl bottle.

#### **Ingredient: Dry White Wine**

* **Analysis**: The wine adds acidity and complexity. A crisp, dry white wine with high acidity is required. Unoaked styles with good fruit character are best.  
* **Recommendations**: A **Pinot Grigio** from Italy or a **Sauvignon Blanc** from France or New Zealand would be perfect. Both are crisp, dry, and have citrus and green fruit notes that will complement the other ingredients.279 Any good quality, widely available supermarket brand will suffice.

### **Pisco Sour**

The national cocktail of both Peru and Chile, the Pisco Sour is a world-class sour cocktail. It combines pisco, fresh lime (or lemon) juice, simple syrup, and egg white, which is shaken to create a rich, frothy texture. A few dashes of bitters are traditionally dropped onto the foam as a garnish.

#### **Ingredient: Pisco**

##### **Profile Requirements**

As with the Pisco Punch, a high-quality Peruvian pisco is the classic choice. While many in Peru insist on a non-aromatic Quebranta pisco, many expert bartenders prefer an "Acholado" (a blend of grapes) or an aromatic "Puro" (like Italia or Torontel). The floral and fruity notes of these aromatic styles pair beautifully with the citrus and create a more fragrant and complex sour.272

##### **Primary Recommendation: La Diablada Pisco Acholado**

* **Analysis**: A superb "Acholado" pisco that is a blend of Quebranta, Moscatel, and Italia grapes. It is specifically praised for its versatility and is considered a great "starter" pisco that excels in cocktails. It has a lightly fruity and floral aroma with a more herbal and spice-driven taste that creates a perfectly balanced Pisco Sour.278  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available from specialist UK retailers. The price is typically £35-£40 for a 70cl bottle.

##### **Secondary Recommendation: BarSol Selecto Acholado**

* **Analysis**: Another excellent Acholado from the highly regarded BarSol distillery. It is a blend of Quebranta, Italia, and Torontel grapes, offering a wonderfully floral and fruity profile that is ideal for a Pisco Sour.278  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available from specialist UK retailers. The price is typically £32-£36 for a 70cl bottle.

##### **Accessible Choice: BarSol Primero Quebranta**

* **Analysis**: For a more traditional, less aromatic Pisco Sour, the BarSol Quebranta is an excellent and widely available choice. It creates a clean, crisp, and classic version of the drink.274  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available from specialist UK retailers. The price is typically £30-£35 for a 70cl bottle.

### **Planters Punch**

A classic and historic rum punch with countless variations, the Planter's Punch is most strongly associated with Jamaica. The core concept follows a traditional rhyme: "One of sour, two of sweet, three of strong, four of weak." Modern recipes often interpret this as a combination of Jamaican rum, lime juice, a sweetener, and bitters. The key is a rich, flavourful Jamaican rum.

#### **Ingredient: Jamaican Rum**

##### **Profile Requirements**

The drink demands a dark or aged Jamaican rum with the characteristic "funk" and rich molasses flavour. The rum is the star of the show, so a high-quality, flavourful spirit is essential.

##### **Primary Recommendation: Appleton Estate Signature Blend**

* **Analysis**: A benchmark aged Jamaican rum and an excellent choice for a Planter's Punch. It is a blend of pot and column still rums, offering a perfect balance of rich, fruity notes, warm honey, and a hint of oak and Jamaican funk. It is versatile and widely praised for its use in classic rum cocktails.283  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in UK supermarkets. The price is typically £25-£28 for a 70cl bottle.

##### **Secondary Recommendation: Coruba Dark Jamaican Rum**

* **Analysis**: A classic "planter's style" dark rum that is a must-have for many Tiki and rum enthusiasts. It has a deep, rich molasses flavour with notes of coffee and spice, and it is specifically recommended for an authentic Planter's Punch.285  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Availability in the UK is limited and primarily through specialist online retailers. Prices can vary significantly depending on the importer.287

##### **For a Funkier Punch: Smith & Cross Traditional Jamaica Rum**

* **Analysis**: For those who want a more intense, "hogo"-driven punch, using Smith & Cross (or blending it with Appleton) will create a powerful and complex drink. Its high proof (57% ABV) and intense tropical fruit notes make for a memorable cocktail.284  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available from specialist UK retailers. The price is typically £40-£49 for a 70cl bottle.55

### **Porn Star Martini**

A modern phenomenon created by bartender Douglas Ankrah in London in the early 2000s, the Pornstar Martini (often renamed Passion Fruit Martini) has become one of the UK's most popular cocktails.293 It is a sweet, tart, and indulgent mix of vanilla vodka, passion fruit liqueur, and passion fruit purée, famously served with a shot of sparkling wine on the side.

#### **Ingredient: Vanilla Vodka**

##### **Profile Requirements**

The quality of the vanilla vodka is crucial. A good one will have a natural, rich vanilla flavour, while cheaper versions can taste artificial and overly sweet. It should be smooth and well-integrated.295

##### **Primary Recommendation: Absolut Vanilia**

* **Analysis**: The long-standing favourite and a reliable choice used in many professional bars.295 It has a strong, pure vanilla flavour with notes of butterscotch and dark chocolate and, importantly, contains no added sugar, allowing the sweetness to be controlled by the other ingredients.  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in all major UK supermarkets. The price is typically £20-£22 for a 70cl bottle.

##### **Secondary Recommendation: JJ Whitley Vanilla Vodka**

* **Analysis**: A UK-made vodka that has gained popularity for its super-smooth profile and punchy, authentic vanilla flavour. In some taste tests, it is preferred over more established brands for its balance of vodka bite and sweet vanilla character.297  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available in some supermarkets and widely online. The price is typically £16-£19 for a 70cl bottle.

##### **Premium Choice: Grey Goose La Vanille**

* **Analysis**: For a truly luxurious Pornstar Martini, this high-end vodka is flavoured with vanilla beans from Madagascar. It offers a complex and nuanced palate with notes of white chocolate, sweet almond, and caramel alongside the primary vanilla flavour.295  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available from premium and specialist retailers. The price is typically £40-£45 for a 70cl bottle.

#### **Ingredient: Passion Fruit Liqueur**

* **Analysis**: This liqueur reinforces the core flavour of the cocktail.  
* **Primary Recommendation: Passoã**. This is the original and essential passion fruit liqueur used in the cocktail's creation. It is made with real passion fruit and provides the signature sweet and tangy tropical flavour.294  
* **Premium Alternative: Chinola Passion Fruit Liqueur**. A higher-end liqueur made from fresh Dominican passion fruit. It offers a brighter, tangier, and more authentic passion fruit flavour that will create a more refined cocktail.300

#### **Ingredient: Champagne to serve on the side**

* **Analysis**: The side shot of sparkling wine is a signature part of the ritual. It is intended to be sipped alternately with the sweet cocktail, acting as a palate cleanser. A dry ("Brut") style is essential.  
* **Recommendation: Prosecco**. There is no need to use expensive Champagne. A good quality, dry Brut Prosecco is the perfect choice. See the Mimosa recommendations for suitable brands like **La Marca** or **Mionetto**.293

### **Porto Flip**

A classic "flip" cocktail, which is a category of drinks that traditionally includes a spirit or fortified wine shaken with sugar and a whole egg or egg yolk. The Porto Flip is a rich, creamy, and decadent drink, perfect as a dessert cocktail. It combines brandy, port wine, and an egg yolk, and is garnished with freshly grated nutmeg.

#### **Ingredient: Brandy**

##### **Profile Requirements**

The recipe calls for brandy, which most typically refers to a grape brandy. A good quality French brandy or Cognac is the ideal choice, providing a smooth, fruity, and slightly spicy base for the drink.

##### **Primary Recommendation: Rémy Martin VSOP Cognac**

* **Analysis**: A high-quality and widely available VSOP (Very Superior Old Pale) Cognac that adds a touch of luxury to the cocktail. It has a complex profile of ripe fruits, vanilla, and a hint of liquorice that pairs beautifully with the richness of the port wine.305  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in UK supermarkets and specialist retailers. The price is typically £40-£45 for a 70cl bottle.

##### **Secondary Recommendation: St-Rémy Authentic VSOP**

* **UK Availability & Price**: Available from specialist UK retailers. The price is typically £45-£50 for a 70cl bottle.

#### **Ingredient: Red Tawny Port Wine**

##### **Profile Requirements**

Tawny port is aged in wooden casks, which gives it a golden-brown colour and complex, nutty, and dried fruit flavours.308 A good quality 10-year-old tawny is a great choice, offering a balance of rich fruit, nutty notes of almond and walnut, and hints of caramel and spice that are perfect for this creamy cocktail.309

##### **Primary Recommendation: Taylor's 10 Year Old Tawny Port**

* **Analysis**: A benchmark 10-year-old tawny from one of the most respected port houses. It has a superb balance of ripe berry fruit, mellow nutty character, and notes of chocolate and butterscotch, making it an excellent and reliable choice.310  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in UK supermarkets and wine merchants. The price is typically £22-£25 for a 75cl bottle.

##### **Secondary Recommendation: Graham's 10 Year Old Tawny Port**

* **UK Availability & Price**: Widely available in UK supermarkets and wine merchants. The price is typically £22-£25 for a 75cl bottle.

##### **Accessible Choice: Warre's Otima 10 Year Old Tawny Port**

* **Analysis**: A slightly lighter style of 10-year-old tawny that is known for its elegant and fresh character, with notes of dried fruit and a hint of honey. It is an excellent value and a great introduction to aged tawny port.310  
* **UK Availability & Price**: Available in many UK supermarkets and wine merchants. The price is typically £18-£20 for a 50cl bottle.

### Rabo de Galo

Brazil's "other" national cocktail, the Rabo de Galo—literally, "tail of the rooster"—is a sophisticated, stirred-down drink that stands as a bold counterpart to the ubiquitous Caipirinha. It is best understood as a Brazilian Negroni, a potent and flavourful aperitif where the funky, vegetal character of cachaça is balanced by the sweet herbal notes of vermouth and the unique bitterness of Cynar. In a drink this spirit-forward, the quality and style of the cachaça are paramount to its success.

#### Cachaça

The choice of cachaça is critical. Unlike a Caipirinha, which can be magnificent with a sharp, unaged (prata) cachaça, the Rabo de Galo's structure demands a spirit with more depth and texture to avoid being overpowered by its bitter and sweet modifiers. The consensus among experts leans towards lightly aged or specific wood-finished expressions that introduce complementary notes of spice, vanilla, or nuttiness.

* Top Recommendation (Enthusiast's Choice): Novo Fogo Chameleon  
  This one-year-aged cachaça is the perfect bridge between styles for this cocktail. It is aged just long enough in repurposed American oak barrels to acquire notes of vanilla, hazelnut, and sweet spice, which beautifully complement the vermouth and Cynar, while still retaining the essential savory, grassy funk of high-quality cachaça. Its versatility and balance make it a true "bartender's friend" for a wide range of drinks, but it finds a particularly harmonious expression in the Rabo de Galo.1  
* Premium Alternative: Matriarca Amburana  
  For a truly elevated and distinctly Brazilian experience, an Amburana wood-aged cachaça is an exceptional choice. Amburana wood imparts unique warm, savoury spice notes reminiscent of cinnamon and tonka bean. One expert sommelier identifies Matriarca Amburana as the "perfect choice" for a Rabo de Galo, describing it as "opulent and perfumed" with a roundness and complexity that creates a deeply memorable version of the cocktail.3  
* Widely Available Alternative: Abelha Prata Organic Cachaça  
  While many recipes favour an aged expression, a high-quality unaged cachaça can produce a clean, vibrant Rabo de Galo that allows the modifiers to take centre stage. Abelha Prata, an organic cachaça, offers a fresh, grassy profile that is far more refined than mass-market brands, making it a superb and accessible option for this drink.4  
* **UK Availability:** Novo Fogo is available in the UK through specialist online retailers such as Urban Drinks.5 Matriarca is a more specialist item and may require dedicated searching. Abelha is more widely available through specialists like Master of Malt.6 Standard mixing brands like  
  **Velho Barreiro** and **Cachaça 51** are available in some larger supermarkets and online and serve as acceptable, if less complex, starting points.6

#### Sweet Vermouth Cinzano Rosso

The user's recipe specifies Cinzano Rosso, a choice rooted in the cocktail's history.

* Confirmation of Standard: Cinzano Rosso  
  Cinzano Rosso is indeed the historical and standard choice. The drink was reputedly created by the brand as a promotional vehicle after establishing a factory in São Paulo.8 It provides a classic, straightforward sweet and herbal profile that is authentic to the cocktail's origins. It is ubiquitous in UK supermarkets.  
* Top Alternative (The Upgrade): Cocchi Vermouth di Torino  
  For a significant step up in complexity, Cocchi Vermouth di Torino is the go-to for bartenders worldwide. It offers a richer, more nuanced profile with distinct notes of cocoa, bitter orange, and rhubarb that add considerable depth and dimension to the Rabo de Galo.10 It is available at Waitrose and specialist retailers.12  
* Rich & Bold Alternative: Carpano Antica Formula  
  For a truly luxurious, vanilla-forward version of the drink, Carpano Antica Formula is the undisputed king of sweet vermouths. Its powerful character can dominate, so it is best suited for those who desire a robust, almost dessert-like expression of the cocktail.14 It is widely available from specialist UK retailers.16

#### Cynar & Angostura Bitters

* The Standard: Cynar and Angostura Aromatic Bitters  
  Cynar is the specified artichoke-based amaro, and its unique vegetal bitterness is irreplaceable in this recipe.18 Angostura Aromatic Bitters is the global standard for bitters. Both are essential staples for any serious bar and are widely available in all major UK supermarkets and specialist spirits retailers.

### Ramos Fizz

A legend of the cocktail world, the Ramos Gin Fizz is as notorious for its demanding preparation as it is celebrated for its ethereal, fluffy texture and delicate flavour. Success with this drink is a testament to technique, but it begins with ingredients that provide the best possible foundation. The choice of gin is particularly important, as it must offer a botanical backbone without clashing with the creamy, floral elements.

#### Gin

The gin's primary role in a Ramos Fizz is to provide a clean, structural foundation. Overly aggressive juniper or dominant floral notes can create jarring flavours when combined with cream, egg white, and orange flower water. The historical use of Old Tom gin and the modern preference for softer styles indicate that balance and integration are the keys to success.

* Top Recommendation (Historical & Flavourful): Hayman's Old Tom Gin  
  The original recipe created by Henry C. Ramos in the 1880s called for Old Tom gin, a slightly sweeter and less intensely botanical style than the London Dry that would later dominate the market.20 Hayman's is the modern benchmark for this historic style. Its gentle sweetness and rich mouthfeel integrate seamlessly with the cream and citrus, creating a smoother, more historically authentic fizz.21  
* Second Recommendation (Modern & Balanced): Plymouth Gin  
  A frequently cited modern alternative, Plymouth Gin occupies a perfect middle ground. It is drier than an Old Tom but softer and more earthy than a classic London Dry. Its subtle notes of citrus and coriander provide a sturdy yet unobtrusive botanical base that complements the other delicate ingredients without overwhelming them.20  
* Widely Available Alternative: Fords Gin or Beefeater London Dry  
  A high-quality, versatile London Dry Gin is a perfectly acceptable and widely used choice for a modern Ramos Fizz. Fords Gin is an excellent option, designed by bartenders for mixing, with a well-balanced profile of juniper, citrus, and spice.20  
  **Beefeater London Dry** is another classic workhorse whose clean, citrus-forward profile creates a bracingly crisp and refreshing version of the drink that many contemporary palates prefer.23  
* **UK Availability:** Hayman's Old Tom is available from specialist retailers.24 Plymouth Gin is widely available in supermarkets and specialist stores like The Whisky Exchange.25 Fords and Beefeater are ubiquitous.

### Remember the Maine

A sophisticated and complex variation on the Manhattan, the Remember the Maine is a connoisseur's drink that pays tribute to a moment in American history. It enhances the classic rye and vermouth base with the rich sweetness of cherry liqueur and the herbal complexity of absinthe. The choice of rye whiskey is crucial; it must have sufficient proof and spice to balance the drink's sweeter elements and stand up to the assertive herbal notes.

#### Rye Whiskey

The potency of the rye is a defining factor in a well-made Remember the Maine. A higher-proof, "bottled-in-bond" rye provides a robust backbone that prevents the cocktail from becoming flabby or overly sweet once stirred with ice and combined with the liqueurs.

* Top Recommendation (The Consensus Choice): Rittenhouse Bottled-in-Bond Rye  
  This is the quintessential mixing rye and the most frequently recommended bottle for this style of cocktail. Its 100-proof (50% ABV) strength ensures its spicy character is not lost amidst the sweet vermouth and Cherry Heering.10 It provides the perfect balance of power and flavour, making it the gold standard for this and many other classic rye cocktails.  
* Second Recommendation (Spicy & Available): Bulleit Rye  
  With a mash bill containing 95% rye, Bulleit offers a pronounced spice and black pepper character that works beautifully in a Remember the Maine, cutting through the sweetness of the other ingredients.27 It is widely available in UK supermarkets, making it an excellent and highly accessible choice.  
* Entry-Level Recommendation: Old Overholt Rye  
  Often cited in American sources as a solid, budget-friendly mixing rye, Old Overholt's availability in the UK is extremely limited and inconsistent.26 While it is a valid choice if found, it cannot be considered a reliable option for UK-based bartenders.  
* **UK Availability:** Rittenhouse is readily available from specialist UK retailers like House of Malt.29 Bulleit Rye is widely available in major supermarkets including Waitrose and Tesco.

#### Sweet Vermouth

* Top Recommendation: Cocchi Vermouth di Torino  
  The complex profile of Cocchi, with its notes of bitter orange, cocoa, and warm spice, is a perfect complement to the rye whiskey and cherry notes in the drink. It is frequently paired with Rittenhouse in enthusiast discussions, indicating a classic, high-quality combination.10  
* Second Recommendation: Vermouth Del Professore Rosso  
  For a richer, more contemplative version of the cocktail, this artisanal vermouth is an excellent choice. It is matured in oak casks, which adds another layer of spice and vanilla that beautifully echoes the notes from the rye whiskey.26  
* **UK Availability:** Cocchi di Torino is available at Waitrose and specialist shops.12 Vermouth Del Professore is a specialist item, available from retailers like The Umbrella Project, though stock can be intermittent.30

#### Cherry Brandy Luxardo

There appears to be a slight misnomer in the user's ingredient list. The classic, historically correct liqueur for the Remember the Maine is Cherry Heering. The user's other cocktail, the Singapore Sling, specifies "Cherry Sangue Morlacco," which is a Luxardo product. For the Remember the Maine, Cherry Heering is the authentic choice.

* The Standard: Cherry Heering  
  This rich, dark Danish cherry liqueur is the universally recommended ingredient. Its deep, complex cherry flavour and significant sweetness are fundamental to the cocktail's established profile and have been since its inception.10  
* Alternative (If Luxardo is Preferred): Luxardo Sangue Morlacco  
  If a Luxardo product is desired, their Sangue Morlacco cherry liqueur could be used. It is a high-quality liqueur made from Marasca cherries, though it presents a slightly tarter profile than Heering.34 It would create a valid, if slightly different, interpretation of the drink.  
* **UK Availability:** Cherry Heering is widely available from UK specialist retailers such as Spiritly and The Whisky World.36

#### Absinthe

* Top Recommendation: La Fée Parisienne Absinthe  
  Difford's Guide, a highly respected resource for cocktail recipes, specifically lists La Fée Parisienne in its formulation for the Remember the Maine, making it a well-vetted and reliable choice.27 It possesses a classic, balanced profile of anise and wormwood.  
* Enthusiast's Alternative: St. George Absinthe Verte  
  This high-quality American absinthe has a strong reputation among connoisseurs for its robust and complex herbal character, which can add a fascinating dimension to the cocktail.38  
* **Note on Application:** Sources vary on whether to rinse the glass with absinthe and discard the excess, or to add a small measure directly to the mixing glass.39 For a more pronounced and integrated herbal character, adding a bar spoon directly to the mix is the preferable method.  
* **UK Availability:** La Fée is available from specialists like Spiritly.41 St. George Absinthe Verte can be found at The Whisky Exchange.42

### Russian Spring Punch

Created in the 1980s by the legendary London bartender Dick Bradsell, the Russian Spring Punch is a modern classic. It is a luxurious, bubbly, and deceptively potent drink that elevates a simple vodka base with rich blackcurrant liqueur and sparkling wine. The quality of both the vodka and the crème de cassis is essential for a truly exceptional result.

#### Vodka

The vodka in a Russian Spring Punch should be clean, crisp, and of high quality, providing a neutral yet smooth canvas that allows the cassis and sparkling wine to be the stars of the show.

* Top Recommendation (Creator's Choice): Ketel One Vodka  
  Multiple authoritative sources, including Diageo Bar Academy and Difford's Guide, specify Ketel One in their recipes for this cocktail.43 Its exceptionally clean and crisp profile, with a subtle hint of citrus and a silky mouthfeel, makes it the perfect, unobtrusive base for this elegant drink.  
* Premium Alternatives: Belvedere or Grey Goose  
  For those seeking a richer texture and mouthfeel, premium grain vodkas like Belvedere or Grey Goose are excellent choices. They are frequently cited in enthusiast forums as top-shelf options that lend a luxurious smoothness to cocktails.45  
* **UK Availability:** Ketel One is widely available in major UK supermarkets like Waitrose and online specialist shops.46 Belvedere and Grey Goose are also ubiquitous, found in nearly all supermarkets and specialist stores.49

#### Crème de Cassis

This is an ingredient where investing in a quality bottle yields a vastly superior drink. Cheaper versions can be cloyingly sweet and taste artificial, whereas authentic French crème de cassis offers a deep, complex, and true blackcurrant flavour.

* Top Recommendation (The Gold Standard): Joseph Cartron Double Crème de Cassis de Bourgogne  
  Difford's Guide specifically recommends this bottling in its recipe, marking it as a benchmark for quality.44 Produced in the heart of Burgundy, it is renowned for its intense, authentic blackcurrant flavour and perfect balance of sweetness and tartness.  
* Excellent Alternative: Giffard Cassis Noir de Bourgogne  
  Giffard is another highly respected French producer of liqueurs. Their Cassis Noir de Bourgogne is an excellent alternative that provides a similarly rich and authentic fruit profile, ensuring a vibrant and flavourful punch.44  
* **UK Availability:** Both Joseph Cartron and Giffard are available from specialist UK retailers such as Amathus Drinks, Spirit Store, and online via Amazon.53 Another classic brand, L'Héritier-Guyot, appears to have poor availability in the UK market.57

### Rusty Nail

A beautifully simple, two-ingredient classic from the mid-20th century, the Rusty Nail is a cocktail that lives or dies by the quality of its Scotch whisky and the balance struck with its partner, Drambuie. The central challenge of this drink is managing the powerful, honeyed sweetness of the liqueur. The ideal Scotch is one that can either complement these notes or provide a stark, smoky contrast.

#### Scotch Whisky

The choice of Scotch for a Rusty Nail is a direct reaction to the dominant profile of Drambuie. Recommendations diverge into two distinct camps: those that seek to harmonize with the sweetness and those that aim to cut through it with smoke and peat.

* Top Recommendation (Balanced Blend): Monkey Shoulder Blended Malt  
  This is the most frequently recommended bottle by both review sites and enthusiasts for a Rusty Nail.58 A blend of Speyside single malts, Monkey Shoulder has prominent notes of butterscotch and vanilla that are a perfect complement to Drambuie's honeyed character. It has enough body and quality to stand up in the drink without being overwhelmed, creating a smooth and harmonious result.  
* Classic & Accessible Blends: The Famous Grouse or Dewar's White Label  
  These are the classic, budget-friendly workhorse blends that will produce a perfectly acceptable and traditional Rusty Nail.58 While they may lack the complexity of a malt blend like Monkey Shoulder, they are reliable and deliver the expected flavour profile of the drink.  
* The Peated Option (Enthusiast's Choice): Ardbeg Wee Beastie  
  For a more complex and challenging take on the cocktail, enthusiasts frequently recommend a peated Islay malt. The robust smoke and medicinal notes of a whisky like Ardbeg's young and feisty "Wee Beastie" provide a fantastic counterpoint to the sweetness of the Drambuie, transforming the drink from a simple sweet sipper into a layered experience of smoke and honey.59 Other excellent choices in this category include  
  **Caol Ila 12 Year Old** or **Douglas Laing's Big Peat**.58  
* **UK Availability:** Monkey Shoulder, The Famous Grouse, and Dewar's are widely available in all major UK supermarkets.61 Ardbeg Wee Beastie, Caol Ila 12, and Big Peat are available from specialist retailers and larger supermarkets with extensive spirits selections.66

#### Drambuie

* Confirmation of Standard: Drambuie  
  Drambuie is the eponymous ingredient in this cocktail, a proprietary liqueur made from Scotch whisky, honey, herbs, and spices. There is no substitute. It is widely available in all major UK supermarkets and specialist retailers.

### Sazerac

The official cocktail of New Orleans, the Sazerac is one of the oldest and most revered American drinks. While modern interpretations often use rye whiskey, the original recipe called for Cognac. The drink is a ritual in a glass, defined by its aromatic absinthe rinse and the distinctive character of Peychaud's Bitters.

#### Cognac

The original Sazerac was made with Sazerac de Forge et Fils Cognac. While that specific brand is now primarily a rye whiskey producer, the spirit of the original calls for a quality Cognac with enough character to shine through.

* Top Recommendation: Rémy Martin 1738 Accord Royal  
  Rémy Martin specifically recommends their 1738 Accord Royal for a Sazerac, noting its "aromatic richness".69 This VSOP-level Cognac has notes of plum, fig, and toffee that work exceptionally well with the anise and spice notes of the cocktail's other ingredients.  
* Second Recommendation: Pierre Ferrand 1840 Original Formula  
  This Cognac was created by Pierre Ferrand in collaboration with cocktail historian David Wondrich to replicate the style of Cognac used in 19th-century cocktails. It is slightly higher in proof and has a robust, spicy character that makes it an outstanding choice for a Sazerac. Reddit users mention Pierre Ferrand as a high-quality option for split-base Sazeracs.70  
* **Split-Base Option:** Many modern bartenders and enthusiasts prefer a "split-base" Sazerac, using equal parts Cognac and rye whiskey. This combines the fruity elegance of the Cognac with the spicy backbone of the rye, creating what many consider the best of both worlds.70 For this, combining  
  **Rémy Martin 1738** with **Rittenhouse Rye** is a superb choice.  
* **UK Availability:** Rémy Martin 1738 Accord Royal and Pierre Ferrand 1840 are available from specialist UK spirits retailers.

#### Absinthe

The absinthe in a Sazerac is typically used as a rinse to coat the inside of the chilled glass, providing an essential aromatic foundation.

* Top Recommendation (The Authentic Choice): Herbsaint  
  Created in New Orleans in 1934 by J.M. Legendre as a substitute for absinthe, Herbsaint quickly became the standard for the Sazerac in its hometown. Its tagline was "Drink Herbsaint Wherever Absinthe Is Called For".71 It is technically a pastis (anise-flavoured liqueur) rather than a true absinthe, but its flavour profile is inextricably linked with this cocktail.  
* Excellent Alternative: St. George Absinthe Verte  
  For those seeking the character of a true absinthe, this American offering is highly regarded by enthusiasts for its quality and complexity. It provides a more intense and layered herbal aroma than Herbsaint.38  
* **UK Availability:** Herbsaint is available in the UK through specialist online retailers like Spiritly.72 St. George Absinthe Verte can be purchased from The Whisky Exchange.42

#### Peychaud’s Bitters

* Confirmation of Standard: Peychaud’s Bitters  
  Peychaud's Bitters are non-negotiable for a true Sazerac. Created by apothecary Antoine Amédée Peychaud in New Orleans, their unique profile of cherry, anise, and floral notes is the defining flavour of the drink. There is no true substitute.  
* **Alternatives for Exploration:** For those looking to experiment, bitters designed to replicate the New Orleans style exist. These include **The Bitter Truth Creole Bitters** and **Scrappy's Orleans Bitters**.73  
  **All The Bitter's New Orleans Bitters** is a non-alcoholic option.73  
* **UK Availability:** Peychaud's Bitters are widely available from specialist retailers. The Bitter Truth Creole Bitters can be found at Amathus Drinks.74 Scrappy's Bitters are available at The Whisky Exchange, though the Orleans variety is not always in stock.75 All The Bitter appears to be primarily available through European non-alcoholic specialists.76

### Sea Breeze

The Sea Breeze is a quintessential tall, refreshing vodka cooler. A simple mix of vodka, cranberry, and grapefruit juice, its quality depends entirely on using a clean, smooth vodka and good quality juices.

#### Vodka

A clean, neutral vodka is ideal for a Sea Breeze, as the goal is to let the fruit juices shine.

* Top Recommendation: Ketel One Vodka  
  Known for its exceptional smoothness and crisp character, Ketel One is an ideal choice. It provides a clean alcoholic base without introducing any unwanted flavours, allowing the tartness of the cranberry and grapefruit to be the focus.46  
* Widely Available Alternatives: Absolut or Stolichnaya  
  These are excellent, widely available workhorse vodkas that are perfect for mixed drinks like the Sea Breeze. They are clean, reliable, and offer great value.45  
* **UK Availability:** Ketel One, Absolut, and Stolichnaya are all widely available in every major UK supermarket and specialist retailer.

### Sex on the Beach

A popular and famously named cocktail from the 1980s, the Sex on the Beach is a fruity, sweet, and easy-drinking highball. Its success relies on a balance between the vodka, the distinctive sweetness of peach schnapps, and the fruit juices.

#### Vodka

As with the Sea Breeze, a clean and neutral vodka is the best choice to act as a base for the other prominent flavours.

* Top Recommendation: Ketel One Vodka  
  A high-quality, smooth vodka like Ketel One provides a clean foundation that won't interfere with the peach and fruit juice flavours.46  
* Widely Available Alternatives: Smirnoff No. 21 or Absolut  
  These globally recognized brands are perfectly suited for this style of cocktail. They are neutral, reliable, and provide the alcoholic backbone without adding any distracting congeners.45  
* **UK Availability:** All recommended vodkas are ubiquitous in the UK market.

#### Peach Schnapps

The choice of peach schnapps or liqueur is key to defining the cocktail's character.

* Top Recommendation (The Classic): Archers Peach Schnapps  
  Archers is the brand most associated with this cocktail and the broader category of peach schnapps in the UK. It delivers the classic sweet, candied peach flavour that is expected in a Sex on the Beach.77  
* The Upgrade (Liqueur): Giffard Pêche de Vigne  
  For a more refined and less overtly sweet version of the drink, substituting a high-quality French peach liqueur (crème de pêche) is an excellent move. Giffard's Pêche de Vigne is made from vineyard peaches and offers a more authentic and complex fruit flavour than standard schnapps.77  
* **UK Availability:** Archers is available in all major UK supermarkets. Giffard Pêche de Vigne is available from specialist retailers. A wide range of other peach schnapps brands, including De Kuyper and own-brand supermarket versions, are also available.77

### Sherry Cobbler

One of the oldest and most influential cocktails, the Sherry Cobbler dates back to the 1830s and was a favourite of Charles Dickens. It is a simple, elegant, and profoundly refreshing drink made by shaking sherry with sugar and citrus and serving it over crushed ice. The choice of sherry dictates the entire character of the drink. The user's recipe calls for a blend of two distinct styles: Amontillado and Palo Cortado.

#### Amontillado Sherry

A nutty, dry Amontillado will require a bit more sugar to balance than a sweeter style of sherry.79

* Top Recommendation: Lustau Los Arcos Amontillado  
  Lustau is one of the most respected sherry houses, and their Los Arcos Amontillado is a benchmark for the style. It offers complex notes of toasted almonds, brine, and wood, providing a superb nutty and dry foundation for a Cobbler.  
* Widely Available Alternative: Waitrose Blueprint Amontillado Sherry  
  Supermarket own-brand sherries can offer excellent value and quality. The Waitrose Blueprint range is well-regarded, and their Amontillado provides the classic nutty, medium-dry profile required for this drink at an accessible price point.80  
* **UK Availability:** Lustau sherries are available from specialist retailers like The Whisky Exchange and some larger Waitrose stores.80 The Waitrose Blueprint Amontillado is available at Waitrose.

#### Palo Cortado Sherry

Palo Cortado is a rarer style of sherry that combines the aromatic elegance of an Amontillado with the body and richness of an Oloroso.

* Top Recommendation: Gonzalez Byass Leonor Palo Cortado  
  The official website for Sherry Wines specifically recommends Leonor Palo Cortado in its recipe for a Sherry Cobbler, making it an authoritative choice.82 It is a rich and elegant sherry with notes of nuts, caramel, and citrus peel.  
* Widely Available Alternative: No.1 Torre del Oro Palo Cortado (Lustau for Waitrose)  
  This sherry, produced by the esteemed house of Lustau exclusively for Waitrose, is an excellent and widely available example of the Palo Cortado style. It is described as having a "nutty richness" and is highly rated by customers.80  
* **UK Availability:** Gonzalez Byass Leonor Palo Cortado can be found at specialist online wine retailers, though it may not be consistently in stock.83 The No.1 Torre del Oro Palo Cortado is readily available at Waitrose.

### Sidecar

A timeless classic from the "Roaring Twenties," the Sidecar is a perfectly balanced sour cocktail that showcases the elegance of Cognac. The formula of spirit, orange liqueur, and lemon juice is simple, but its success hinges on using high-quality ingredients, as there is nowhere for inferior spirits to hide.

#### Cognac

A VSOP (Very Superior Old Pale) Cognac is generally recommended for a Sidecar. It has enough age to provide complexity and smoothness but is not so old and expensive that its nuances would be lost in a mixed drink.

* Top Recommendation: H by Hine VSOP  
  Hine is a highly respected Cognac house, and their H by Hine VSOP is specifically blended for use in cocktails. It offers a lighter, fresher, and more floral profile than many other VSOPs, with notes of fresh apricot that beautifully complement the orange and lemon in a Sidecar.84  
* Second Recommendation: Rémy Martin VSOP  
  A renowned and respected Cognac, Rémy Martin's VSOP is a versatile and excellent choice. It has a rich, fruity character that pairs wonderfully with the other ingredients, creating a classic and well-balanced Sidecar.85  
* Classic Alternative: Courvoisier VSOP  
  Courvoisier is another of the "big four" Cognac houses. Their VSOP is a high-quality option with notes of pear and grapefruit that bring a unique fruit character to the cocktail.84  
* **UK Availability:** All recommended Cognacs are widely available in major UK supermarkets and specialist spirits retailers.

#### Triple Sec

The choice of orange liqueur is a critical factor in the final balance of the Sidecar.

* Top Recommendation (The Gold Standard): Cointreau  
  Cointreau is almost universally cited as the best orange liqueur for a Sidecar. It is a triple sec, but of a much higher quality than generic brands. Its flavour profile strikes the perfect balance between sweetness and dryness, with a clean, bright orange character that allows the Cognac to shine.84  
* Second Recommendation (The Cognac-Based Option): Pierre Ferrand Dry Curaçao  
  This liqueur, created by Cognac producer Pierre Ferrand, is based on a historical 19th-century recipe. It uses a base of brandy and has a drier, more complex profile than Cointreau, with notes of bitter orange peel, spice, and nuts. It creates a richer, more complex Sidecar and is a favourite among cocktail enthusiasts.86  
* **UK Availability:** Cointreau is ubiquitous in UK supermarkets. Pierre Ferrand Dry Curaçao is available from specialist retailers like The Good Wine Shop.89

### Singapore Sling

A legendary and complex tropical cocktail with a contested history, the Singapore Sling is a long, refreshing drink with a multitude of ingredients. To prevent it from becoming a muddled mess, it is essential to use high-quality, well-defined components, especially the gin.

#### Gin

A classic London Dry Gin is the traditional choice, providing a firm juniper and botanical backbone to stand up to the numerous fruit and liqueur components.

* Top Recommendation: Tanqueray London Dry Gin  
  Tanqueray is an excellent choice for a Singapore Sling. Its assertive, juniper-forward profile ensures that the gin character is not lost amidst the pineapple, cherry, and herbal liqueurs.90  
* Second Recommendation: Beefeater London Dry  
  Another iconic London Dry, Beefeater has a bold, citrus-forward character that works very well with the pineapple and lime juices in the recipe, creating a bright and refreshing sling.91  
* **UK Availability:** Both Tanqueray and Beefeater are available in all major UK supermarkets and specialist retailers.

#### Cherry Sangue Morlacco

The user has specified Luxardo's Cherry Sangue Morlacco.

* **Confirmation of Standard:** While the original Singapore Sling recipe from the Raffles Hotel is thought to have used Cherry Heering, Luxardo's Sangue Morlacco is an exceptionally high-quality cherry liqueur and an excellent choice for the drink.34 It is made from Marasca cherries and has an intense, rich flavour that is both sweet and tart.  
* The Classic Alternative: Cherry Heering  
  For a more historically traditional version of the cocktail, Cherry Heering is the classic choice. It is a Danish liqueur with a deep, rich, and slightly spicy cherry profile that has been associated with the Singapore Sling for over a century.92  
* **UK Availability:** Luxardo Sangue Morlacco can be found at specialist online retailers. Cherry Heering is widely available from specialists like Spiritly and The Whisky World.36

#### Cointreau

* Confirmation of Standard: Cointreau  
  Cointreau is the benchmark high-quality triple sec and the ideal choice for this cocktail. Its clean, bright orange flavour integrates well without adding excessive sweetness.91  
* **Alternatives:** Other high-quality triple secs or dry curaçaos like **Luxardo Triplum** or **Combier Liqueur d'Orange** would also work well.95  
  **Grand Marnier** could be used, but its Cognac base would add a darker, spicier note not traditionally found in the drink.95  
* **UK Availability:** Cointreau is ubiquitous. The alternatives are available from specialist spirits retailers.

#### DOM Bénédictine

* Confirmation of Standard: D.O.M. Bénédictine  
  This unique and complex French herbal liqueur is an essential and irreplaceable component of the Singapore Sling. Its notes of honey, saffron, and myriad other botanicals are key to the drink's signature flavour profile.  
* **Alternatives:** While there is no direct substitute, some liqueurs share a similar herbal-sweet profile. **Yellow Chartreuse** is perhaps the closest in complexity, though with a different herbal character. **Drambuie** shares the honey and herbal notes but is whisky-based.97 Using these would create a significantly different drink, but they are valid avenues for experimentation.  
* **UK Availability:** D.O.M. Bénédictine is widely available in major UK supermarkets and specialist retailers.

### South Side

A classic Prohibition-era cocktail, the South Side is essentially a gin Mojito served "up" in a cocktail glass. It is a clean, bright, and refreshing combination of gin, citrus, sugar, and mint. A crisp London Dry Gin is the perfect choice to complement the fresh mint and lime.

#### London dry Gin

* Top Recommendation (Specified Choice): Tanqueray London Dry Gin  
  Diageo Bar Academy's recipe for the South Side specifically calls for Tanqueray.98 Its high-proof, juniper-forward, and crisp botanical profile is an ideal match for the bright mint and lime, creating a sharp and invigorating cocktail.  
* Excellent Alternative: Broker's London Dry Gin  
  One enthusiast recipe highlights Broker's Gin as their choice for a South Side.99 Broker's is a classic, well-respected London Dry with a robust juniper backbone and spicy notes of coriander that stand up well in this refreshing sour.  
* **UK Availability:** Tanqueray is available everywhere. Broker's Gin is available from specialist retailers and some larger supermarkets.

### Spicy Fifty

A modern classic created by the legendary bartender Salvatore Calabrese, the Spicy Fifty is a perfectly balanced cocktail of sweet, sour, and spicy. It combines vanilla vodka with elderflower, honey, lime, and a kick of fresh red chilli.

#### Vodka Vanilla

* Top Recommendation (Creator's Choice): Stoli Vanil  
  In his own recipe for the cocktail, Salvatore Calabrese specifies that he uses Stoli Vanil.100 This makes it the definitive choice for an authentic Spicy Fifty. Stoli's vanilla flavour is well-regarded for being clean and not overly artificial.  
* Premium Alternative: Absolut Vanilia  
  Absolut's vanilla-flavoured expression is another high-quality and widely available option. It offers a rich vanilla flavour with notes of caramel and butterscotch that would work beautifully in this cocktail.  
* **UK Availability:** Both Stoli Vanil and Absolut Vanilia are available in major UK supermarkets and specialist retailers.

#### Elderflower Cordial

* Top Recommendation: Belvoir Farm Elderflower Cordial  
  Belvoir Farm is a highly-rated UK producer of cordials, praised for its fresh and intense elderflower flavour.101 Using a high-quality cordial like this, made from real elderflowers, is crucial for achieving the desired floral note without adding artificial sweetness.  
* Second Recommendation: Bottlegreen Elderflower Cordial  
  Bottlegreen is another excellent and widely available British brand. Its cordial is also highly rated and provides a clean, authentic elderflower taste that is perfect for cocktails.101  
* **Note on Liqueur vs. Cordial:** Some recipes for similar cocktails may call for an elderflower liqueur like St-Germain.102 The original Spicy Fifty recipe uses a non-alcoholic cordial. Using a liqueur would increase the drink's sweetness and alcohol content, requiring an adjustment to the honey syrup.  
* **UK Availability:** Belvoir Farm and Bottlegreen cordials are available in all major UK supermarkets.

### Spritz

The Spritz, particularly the Aperol Spritz, has become a global phenomenon. It is a simple and refreshing aperitivo combining prosecco, a bitter liqueur, and a splash of soda water. The choice of prosecco is key to the drink's balance.

#### Prosecco

The ideal prosecco for a Spritz is a dry or extra-dry style. It should be crisp and refreshing, with enough acidity to balance the sweetness of the Aperol, but not so complex or expensive that its nuances are lost.

* Top Recommendation (Bartender's Consensus): La Marca Prosecco  
  In a survey of bartenders, La Marca emerged as the overwhelming favourite for making an Aperol Spritz.103 It is praised for its bright, crisp, and clean profile, with notes of green apple and citrus. It is dry enough to balance the Aperol without overpowering it and is both affordable and widely available. Enthusiasts on Reddit also frequently recommend it as a consistent and well-priced option.104  
* **Excellent Alternatives:** Other brands that receive positive mentions from enthusiasts include **Bisol**, **Bele Casel**, and **Ca'Vittoria**.104 These are often praised for their quality and balance, making them great choices for a slightly more elevated Spritz.  
* **UK Availability:** La Marca Prosecco is widely available in UK supermarkets, including Tesco and Sainsbury's. The other recommended brands can be found at specialist wine retailers.

#### Aperol

* Confirmation of Standard: Aperol  
  Aperol is the defining ingredient of the modern Spritz. Its unique bittersweet profile of orange and rhubarb is essential.  
* **Alternatives:** For those looking to explore the broader world of Italian bitter aperitivi, there are many alternatives. **Campari** creates a more bitter and intense Spritz. Other options include **Cocchi Americano** for a lighter, more floral version, or **Italicus Rosolio di Bergamotto** for a highly aromatic, citrus-driven take.105 Non-alcoholic alternatives like  
  **Lyre's Italian Spritz** or **Novara Aperitivo** are also available.106  
* **UK Availability:** Aperol is ubiquitous. The alternatives are available from specialist retailers.

### Stinger

A classic pre-Prohibition nightcap, the Stinger is a deceptively simple two-ingredient cocktail combining Cognac and white crème de menthe. Its success depends entirely on the quality of its components; a good Stinger is sophisticated and bracing, while a bad one is medicinal.

#### Cognac

A good quality VSOP Cognac is the ideal choice. It should be smooth and mellow, with enough character to stand up to the powerful mint flavour.

* Top Recommendation: Pierre Ferrand Ambre  
  Enthusiasts on Reddit highlight Pierre Ferrand Ambre as an excellent choice for a Stinger.107 This Grande Champagne Cognac is known for its bright, floral, and fruity notes, which provide a beautiful contrast to the cool mint of the liqueur.  
* Second Recommendation: H by Hine VSOP  
  As with the Sidecar, H by Hine is an excellent cocktail-focused Cognac. Its lighter, elegant profile prevents the drink from becoming too heavy or cloying.84  
* Widely Available Alternative: Hennessy V.S  
  Hennessy is a globally recognized brand, and their V.S expression is bold and fragrant, with enough character to make a flavourful Stinger. The brand itself promotes its use in a "Stinger Sour" variation.108  
* **UK Availability:** Pierre Ferrand Ambre is available from specialist retailers. Hine VSOP and Hennessy V.S are widely available in major supermarkets.

#### White Crème de Menthe

The quality of the crème de menthe is arguably even more important than the Cognac. A high-quality liqueur will taste of fresh mint, while cheaper versions can be harsh and artificial. White crème de menthe is specified to ensure the drink has an appealing amber colour.109

* Top Recommendation (The Gold Standard): Tempus Fugit Crème de Menthe Glaciale  
  This Swiss-made liqueur is a recreation of a historical 19th-century recipe and is widely considered the best crème de menthe available. It is distilled from botanicals and has a clean, complex, and intensely minty flavour that is far superior to its competitors. One enthusiast notes they "couldn't imagine using any other brand".107  
* Widely Available Alternative: Giffard or De Kuyper  
  These are reputable liqueur producers whose white crème de menthe offers a significant step up in quality from the cheapest options on the market. They provide a clean mint flavour suitable for a good Stinger.  
* **UK Availability:** Tempus Fugit is a specialist item available from retailers like The Whisky Exchange. Giffard and De Kuyper are more widely available from specialist online stores and some larger retailers.

### Suffering Bastard

Created in Cairo during World War II as a hangover cure for British officers, the Suffering Bastard is a unique and highly refreshing long drink. It combines the unusual pairing of brandy and gin with lime juice, Angostura bitters, and a top-up of spicy ginger beer.

#### Cognac or Brandy

* Top Recommendation: Hennessy Privilège VSOP Cognac  
  One authoritative source on the cocktail's recipe specifically calls for Hennessy Privilège VSOP.110 Its smooth and well-balanced profile of fruit and spice provides a solid, high-quality base for the drink.  
* **UK Availability:** Hennessy VSOP is widely available in all major UK supermarkets and specialist retailers.

#### Gin

The gin should be flavourful enough to hold its own against the Cognac and ginger beer. A classic, robust style is ideal.

* Top Recommendation: Plymouth Gin  
  The same source that specifies Hennessy also calls for Plymouth Gin.110 Plymouth's unique, slightly earthy and full-bodied character makes it an excellent choice, providing a botanical depth that complements the other ingredients perfectly.  
* Alternative (Citrus-Forward): Tanqueray Rangpur Lime  
  For a version that leans into the citrus notes, a gin like Tanqueray Rangpur Lime is an excellent choice. Its pronounced lime character will amplify the fresh lime juice and create a particularly zesty and refreshing drink.111  
* **UK Availability:** Plymouth Gin is widely available in most supermarkets. Tanqueray Rangpur Lime is also available in major supermarkets and specialist stores.

### Tequila Sunrise

A visually stunning and universally popular cocktail, the Tequila Sunrise gets its name from its layered appearance, which mimics a sunrise. It's a simple build of tequila, orange juice, and grenadine. A good quality blanco tequila is essential for a clean, crisp taste.

#### Tequila

A 100% blue Weber agave blanco (or silver) tequila is the best choice. It offers a clean, agave-forward flavour that will complement the orange juice without adding the oaky notes of an aged tequila.

* Top Recommendation: Espolòn Blanco  
  Espolòn Blanco is frequently recommended as a top choice for a Tequila Sunrise.112 It has a bright, crisp profile with notes of citrus, pepper, and tropical fruit that enhance the cocktail's fruity character. It offers excellent quality for its price point.  
* Second Recommendation: Don Julio Blanco  
  Another excellent 100% agave tequila, Don Julio Blanco is known for its smooth and crisp profile with zesty citrus notes that are a natural pairing for the orange juice in a Sunrise.112  
* Smooth Alternative: Casamigos Blanco  
  For a particularly smooth and well-rounded Tequila Sunrise, Casamigos Blanco is a great option. It has subtle notes of vanilla and citrus that blend seamlessly with the other ingredients.112  
* **UK Availability:** Espolòn, Don Julio, and Casamigos are all widely available in the UK, with Don Julio and Casamigos found in most major supermarkets, and Espolòn available from specialists and some larger stores.113

### Three Dots and a Dash

A classic tiki cocktail from the legendary Don the Beachcomber, Three Dots and a Dash is a complex and potent drink named for the Morse code for "V" (for Victory). It requires a specific and unusual blend of rums: a French-style rhum agricole and a blended aged rum.

#### Rhum Martinique Agricole

This refers to a specific style of rum from Martinique, distilled from fresh sugarcane juice rather than molasses. An aged expression (vieux) is typically called for to provide grassy, funky, and spicy notes.

* Top Recommendation: Clément VSOP Rhum Agricole Vieux  
  This is the specific aged agricole rhum used by one enthusiast and expert in their recreation of the cocktail.116 Clément is a benchmark producer from Martinique, and their VSOP is aged for four years, giving it complex notes of wood, spice, and dried fruit that complement the tiki spices in the drink perfectly.  
* **UK Availability:** Clément VSOP is available from specialist UK spirits retailers like The Whisky Exchange.

#### Blended Aged Rum

This is a broader category, but for this cocktail, it typically implies a Demerara rum or a rich, dark Jamaican rum to provide a deep, molasses-driven counterpoint to the bright agricole.

* Top Recommendation (Demerara): Skipper Rum  
  The same expert source that recommends Clément VSOP uses Skipper Rum as the Demerara component.116 Skipper is a Guyanese Demerara rum known for its rich, dark sugar and treacle notes.  
* Alternative (Jamaican): Appleton Estate Signature Blend  
  A good quality aged Jamaican rum like Appleton Estate Signature would also be an excellent choice, bringing notes of tropical fruit and a characteristic Jamaican "funk" to the blend.  
* **UK Availability:** Skipper Rum is available from specialist retailers. Appleton Estate Signature is widely available in all major UK supermarkets.117

#### Falernum

* Top Recommendation: John D. Taylor's Velvet Falernum  
  This is the most widely available and classic brand of falernum, a spiced and sweetened liqueur from Barbados with notes of lime, almond, and clove.116 It is considered by many to be the original and is a staple of tiki bartending.  
* **UK Availability:** John D. Taylor's Velvet Falernum is available from specialist retailers like The Umbrella Project.119

### Tipperary

A classic Irish whiskey cocktail that mirrors the structure of a Manhattan with the addition of Green Chartreuse. The result is a robust, herbaceous, and complex drink where the choice of whiskey is key to balancing the powerful Chartreuse.

#### Irish Whiskey

A smooth, triple-distilled Irish whiskey is the traditional choice, but one with enough character to not be completely overshadowed by the other ingredients is ideal.

* Top Recommendation: Redbreast 12 Year Old  
  While many recipes simply call for "Irish whiskey," a high-quality Single Pot Still Irish whiskey like Redbreast 12 will elevate this cocktail significantly. Its rich, spicy, and fruity character, a hallmark of the pot still style, has the weight and complexity to stand alongside the sweet vermouth and intense Green Chartreuse.  
* Widely Available Workhorse: Jameson Black Barrel  
  For a more accessible but still characterful option, Jameson Black Barrel is an excellent choice. It has a higher proportion of pot still whiskey than the standard Jameson and is aged in double-charred barrels, giving it enhanced notes of spice, vanilla, and caramel that work beautifully in a Tipperary.  
* **UK Availability:** Redbreast 12 and Jameson Black Barrel are both widely available in major UK supermarkets and specialist retailers.

#### Sweet Red Vermouth

* Top Recommendation: Cocchi Vermouth di Torino  
  As with other whiskey-based cocktails, the rich and spicy profile of Cocchi di Torino is an ideal match for the Irish whiskey and Green Chartreuse.  
* **UK Availability:** Cocchi di Torino is available at Waitrose and specialist retailers.12

#### Green Chartreuse

* Confirmation of Standard: Green Chartreuse  
  This unique, intensely herbal French liqueur is irreplaceable. There is no substitute for its complex blend of 130 botanicals. It is an essential bottle for any serious cocktail bar.  
* **UK Availability:** Green Chartreuse is available from specialist retailers and some larger supermarkets like Waitrose.

### Tommy's Margarita

A modern classic created in the early 1990s by Julio Bermejo at Tommy's Mexican Restaurant in San Francisco, this cocktail revolutionised the Margarita. By swapping the traditional orange liqueur for agave nectar, it places the focus squarely on the quality of the tequila.

#### Tequila 100% agave

The recipe explicitly calls for 100% agave tequila, and a high-quality blanco is the perfect choice to deliver a crisp, agave-forward flavour.

* Top Recommendation: Espolòn Blanco  
  MyBartender.com and other sources recommend Espolòn as a top choice for a Tommy's Margarita.120 Its bright agave character, with notes of pepper and citrus, is exactly what this cocktail is designed to showcase.  
* Second Recommendation: Don Julio Blanco  
  Another premium 100% agave tequila, Don Julio Blanco is praised for its smooth, clean profile and crisp citrus notes, making it another excellent option for a pure, tequila-forward Tommy's.120  
* Widely Available Alternative: Patrón Silver  
  Patrón is a globally recognized premium brand and a reliable choice for a smooth and well-made Tommy's Margarita.120  
* **UK Availability:** All three recommended tequilas are widely available in the UK. Don Julio and Patrón are in most major supermarkets, while Espolòn is available from specialists and larger supermarket stores.113

### Trinidad Sour

An unconventional and modern classic, the Trinidad Sour is unique in that its base ingredient is Angostura Bitters, with rye whiskey playing a supporting role. The orgeat syrup provides sweetness and texture to balance the intense spice of the bitters.

#### Angostura Bitters

* Confirmation of Standard: Angostura Aromatic Bitters  
  This is the base of the drink. A full ounce or more is used, which is highly unusual. There is no substitute. It is widely available.

#### Orgeat Syrup

* Top Recommendation: Liquid Alchemist Almond Orgeat Syrup  
  Liquid Alchemist is a producer of high-quality cocktail syrups, and their orgeat is specifically recommended for a Trinidad Sour.121 A good orgeat, made with real almonds, is crucial for the texture and flavour of this drink.  
* **UK Availability:** Liquid Alchemist syrups are primarily available in the US but can be ordered online for international shipping.122 High-quality orgeat syrups from brands like Giffard or Monin are more readily available in the UK from specialist retailers.

#### Rye Whiskey

The rye whiskey here is a supporting actor, not the star. A reliable, spicy mixing rye is all that is needed.

* Top Recommendation: Rittenhouse Bottled-in-Bond Rye  
  Its 100-proof strength and spicy character will provide the necessary backbone without getting lost under the massive dose of Angostura bitters.  
* Alternative Recommendation: Blackland Rye  
  One distillery recipe for the Trinidad Sour naturally recommends its own product, Blackland Rye.123 However, this is a Texas-based craft distillery with no distribution in the UK.124  
* **UK Availability:** Rittenhouse Rye is available from specialist UK retailers.29

### Tuxedo

A classic, elegant cocktail from the late 19th century, the Tuxedo is a complex variation on the Martini. It calls for the historic Old Tom style of gin and adds dashes of maraschino liqueur and absinthe for additional complexity.

#### Old Tom Gin

Old Tom gin is sweeter and less juniper-forward than London Dry, with a richer mouthfeel that is essential for the classic profile of a Tuxedo or Martinez.

* Top Recommendation: Ransom Old Tom Gin  
  Ransom Old Tom is a highly respected American craft gin that is a recreation of the historic style. It is aged in wine barrels, giving it a straw colour and a rich, malty, and complex flavour profile that is ideal for a sophisticated Tuxedo.125  
* Second Recommendation: Hayman's Old Tom Gin  
  Hayman's is the benchmark for the classic English style of Old Tom. It is clearer and more botanically driven than Ransom but still possesses the characteristic sweetness and rounded texture that defines the category.21  
* **UK Availability:** Ransom Old Tom is a specialist import and can be difficult to find in the UK, though some online European retailers may ship it.126 Hayman's Old Tom is more readily available from UK specialist retailers.24

#### Dry Vermouth

A high-quality French dry vermouth is the ideal choice to complement the gin without adding too much assertive flavour.

* Top Recommendation: Dolin Vermouth de Chambéry Dry  
  Dolin is considered the benchmark for the light, floral, and subtly herbal Chambéry style of vermouth. It is the perfect choice for a Tuxedo or a classic Martini, as it adds dryness and complexity without overwhelming the gin.127  
* Second Recommendation: Noilly Prat Extra Dry  
  The other classic French dry vermouth, Noilly Prat, is slightly more full-bodied and has a distinct oxidative, saline note from its unique outdoor aging process. It creates a more robust and savoury version of the cocktail.127  
* **UK Availability:** Both Dolin and Noilly Prat are widely available in major UK supermarkets and specialist retailers.

### Ve.N.To

A contemporary Italian cocktail, the Ve.N.To (an acronym for Veneto and Trentino) is notable for being the first grappa-based cocktail on the IBA's official list. It is a sour-style drink that highlights grappa's aromatic qualities with chamomile and honey.

#### White Smooth Grappa

The recipe calls for a "white smooth grappa" (grappa bianca). This means an unaged grappa, but one of high quality that is not harsh or fiery. A grappa made from a single aromatic grape variety (monovitigno) is an excellent choice.

* Top Recommendation: Nonino Grappa Monovitigno Moscato  
  Nonino is one of Italy's most prestigious grappa producers. Their Moscato grappa is exceptionally smooth, aromatic, and fragrant, with notes of rose petals and sage, making it a perfect and elegant base for the Ve.N.To.  
* Excellent Alternative: Alexander Grappa Bianca  
  This is a modern, clean, and fragrant grappa from the Veneto region. It is refined in steel tanks for six months, resulting in a soft and smooth spirit with aromas of fresh fruit that would work beautifully in this cocktail.128  
* **UK Availability:** Nonino grappas are available from specialist Italian delicatessens and high-end spirits retailers like Field & Fawcett.129 Alexander Grappa Bianca is available from UK-based online retailers like Le Bon Vin.128

#### Chamomile Cordial

* **Recommendation:** A high-quality, homemade or artisanal chamomile cordial is best for this drink. Commercial options are limited in the UK. One can purchase dried chamomile flowers from retailers like Grape Tree or Buy Wholefoods Online to create an infused honey syrup as per the recipe's "honey mix" suggestion.130 St. Steve's is a US brand making a well-reviewed cordial, but UK availability is unlikely.132

### Vesper

Immortalised by Ian Fleming in the 1957 James Bond novel *Casino Royale*, the Vesper is a potent and aromatic Martini variation. It is defined by its specific combination of gin, vodka, and the French aperitif wine Lillet Blanc.

#### Gin

Bond specifies "three measures of Gordon's," but modern Gordon's gin is lower in proof and different in character from the 1950s version. A high-quality, classic London Dry gin is the best choice for a modern Vesper.

* Top Recommendation: Tanqueray London Dry Gin  
  Tanqueray's assertive, juniper-forward profile and higher proof (43.1% or 47.3% ABV depending on the bottling) make it an excellent choice to stand up to the vodka and Lillet. It provides the strong botanical backbone that the drink requires.133  
* Second Recommendation: Fords Gin  
  Fords Gin is specifically recommended by the brand for a Vesper Martini.135 It is a well-balanced London Dry designed for cocktails and works exceptionally well in this recipe.  
* **UK Availability:** Both Tanqueray and Fords are widely available in the UK.

#### Vodka

Bond requests a vodka "distilled from grain instead of potatoes." This points towards a clean, smooth, neutral style of vodka.

* Top Recommendation: Belvedere or Grey Goose  
  These premium, grain-based vodkas are excellent choices for a Vesper. They provide the alcoholic weight and a silky texture without interfering with the flavours of the gin and Lillet.133  
* Classic Alternative: Stolichnaya  
  Based on Fleming's writing, it is often suggested that Stolichnaya could have been Bond's preferred brand. It is a classic, high-quality grain vodka that works perfectly in the drink.136  
* **UK Availability:** All recommended vodkas are widely available in UK supermarkets.

#### Lillet Blanc

* Confirmation of Standard: Lillet Blanc  
  Lillet Blanc is the specified ingredient. However, the original ingredient in Fleming's novel was Kina Lillet, a more bitter, quinine-laced aperitif that was reformulated in 1986\.  
* The Authentic Alternative: Cocchi Americano  
  For a Vesper that is closer in flavour to the original, many cocktail connoisseurs recommend substituting Lillet Blanc with Cocchi Americano. Cocchi contains cinchona bark (the source of quinine) and has a more pronounced bitterness that better replicates the profile of Kina Lillet.133  
* **UK Availability:** Lillet Blanc is widely available in major supermarkets. Cocchi Americano is available from Waitrose and specialist retailers.

### Vieux Carré

Another iconic cocktail from New Orleans, the Vieux Carré ("Old Square," referring to the French Quarter) is a complex, spirit-forward sipper. It is a rich and layered blend of rye whiskey, Cognac, sweet vermouth, and Bénédictine.

#### Rye Whiskey

A robust, spicy rye is needed to balance the richness of the Cognac and the sweetness of the vermouth and Bénédictine.

* Top Recommendation: Sazerac Rye  
  Named for the other famous New Orleans cocktail, Sazerac Rye is a natural and excellent choice for a Vieux Carré. It has a perfect balance of spice and sweetness that complements the other ingredients beautifully.85  
* Second Recommendation: Rittenhouse Bottled-in-Bond Rye  
  As with other classic rye cocktails, Rittenhouse's 100-proof strength and bold character make it a superb and frequently recommended option for a powerful and well-structured Vieux Carré.85  
* **UK Availability:** Sazerac Rye and Rittenhouse Rye are both available from specialist UK retailers like House of Malt.29

#### Cognac

A versatile VSOP Cognac is the ideal choice, providing fruity depth and smoothness.

* Top Recommendation: Martell VSOP  
  The Glenlivet's recipe for a Vieux Carré specifically calls for Martell VS, noting its fine, rich blend of fruity notes.139 Using the slightly older VSOP expression would be a direct upgrade.  
* Second Recommendation: Pierre Ferrand 1840 Original Formula  
  As previously mentioned, this Cognac is designed for classic cocktails. Its rich, fruity, and spicy profile enhances the drink's overall complexity and makes it an excellent choice.85  
* **UK Availability:** Martell VSOP is widely available in supermarkets. Pierre Ferrand 1840 is available from specialist retailers.

#### Sweet Vermouth

* Top Recommendation: Cocchi Vermouth di Torino  
  One high-quality recipe specifically calls for Cocchi Vermouth di Torino.140 Its complex, spicy, and bittersweet character is a perfect match for the other assertive ingredients in a Vieux Carré.  
* **UK Availability:** Cocchi di Torino is available at Waitrose and specialist retailers.12

### Whiskey Sour

A fundamental and enduring classic, the Whiskey Sour is a simple but sublime combination of whiskey, lemon juice, and sugar. While it can be made with any whiskey, American bourbon is the most common and arguably best choice, its inherent sweetness and vanilla notes providing a perfect counterpoint to the sharp lemon.

#### Bourbon Whiskey

The ideal bourbon for a Whiskey Sour is well-balanced, with a good measure of caramel and vanilla sweetness but also enough spice from the oak to create a complex drink.

* Top Recommendation: Buffalo Trace  
  Buffalo Trace is the top recommendation from one expert analysis, praised for its perfect, well-rounded profile of caramel sweetness, soft spice, and a smooth finish.141 It blends seamlessly with the lemon and sugar to create a complex yet approachable sour.  
* Second Recommendation (Smoother & Sweeter): Maker's Mark  
  Maker's Mark is a "wheated" bourbon, meaning wheat is used as the secondary grain instead of rye. This results in a softer, sweeter, and less spicy profile. It is an excellent choice for those who prefer a milder, smoother Whiskey Sour with prominent notes of caramel and vanilla.141  
* Third Recommendation (Richer & Spicier): Woodford Reserve  
  Woodford Reserve has a higher rye content in its mash bill than Maker's Mark, giving it a spicier character. It offers a more complex and layered experience, with notes of dried fruit, dark chocolate, and spice, making for a richer and more robust sour.141  
* **UK Availability:** All three recommended bourbons—Buffalo Trace, Maker's Mark, and Woodford Reserve—are widely available in all major UK supermarkets and specialist retailers.

### White Lady

A classic gin sour from the 1920s, the White Lady is an elegant, all-white cocktail that is essentially a Sidecar with gin instead of Cognac. It is a crisp, clean, and refreshing drink where the quality of the gin and orange liqueur is paramount.

#### Gin

The gin for a White Lady should be a classic London Dry style. It needs a detectable juniper character to provide a botanical counterpoint to the citrus, but it should not be overly floral, which could clash with the orange liqueur.

* Top Recommendation: Beefeater London Dry  
  Beefeater is frequently cited as a go-to gin for a White Lady.91 It is an iconic and classic London Dry with a bold, juniper- and citrus-forward profile that is perfectly suited to this crisp, clean sour.  
* Second Recommendation: Tanqueray London Dry  
  Another classic and iconic London Dry, Tanqueray's more assertive, juniper-heavy profile creates a bracing and botanically intense version of the drink.91  
* **UK Availability:** Both Beefeater and Tanqueray are ubiquitous in the UK market.

#### Triple Sec

The choice of a clear, high-quality orange liqueur is essential to both the flavour and the appearance of the White Lady.

* Top Recommendation (The Gold Standard): Cointreau  
  Cointreau is the historically correct and universally recommended orange liqueur for this cocktail.88 It is a clear triple sec of exceptional quality, and its perfect balance of sweetness and dryness is key to the drink's success. Its clarity also ensures the cocktail's signature pale, "white" appearance.  
* **Alternatives:** Other high-quality clear triple secs or dry curaçaos like **Pierre Ferrand Dry Curaçao** or **Luxardo Triplum** would also work well, though the former may add a slight colour to the drink.88  
* **UK Availability:** Cointreau is available in all UK supermarkets. The alternatives are available from specialist retailers.

### Zombie

The Zombie is the undisputed king of tiki cocktails. Invented by Donn Beach in the 1930s, it is a notoriously potent and incredibly complex blend of multiple rums, fruit juices, and spiced syrups. Assembling a true Zombie requires a well-stocked and specific rum collection.

#### Jamaican dark rum

This calls for a rich, funky, pot-still Jamaican rum.

* Top Recommendation: Hamilton Jamaican Pot Still Black Rum  
  This is a highly-regarded rum among tiki enthusiasts, known for its deep flavour and authentic pot-still "funk." It is frequently recommended for classic tiki drinks that require a dark Jamaican rum.118  
* Widely Available Alternative: Myers's Original Dark Rum  
  Myers's is the classic, widely available dark Jamaican rum. While some modern enthusiasts find it less complex than craft options like Hamilton, it is the traditional choice and will make an excellent Zombie.118  
* **UK Availability:** Hamilton rums have very poor distribution in the UK and are primarily a US product.143 Myers's Original Dark Rum is more readily available through specialist UK retailers.148

#### Gold Puerto Rican rum

This refers to a lightly aged, column-still rum. The original recipes would have used Cuban rum, but Puerto Rican rum became the standard substitute.

* Top Recommendation: Bacardí Añejo Cuatro  
  Bacardí is of Cuban heritage and now produced primarily in Puerto Rico. Their Añejo Cuatro is aged for four years and has notes of vanilla, toasted oak, and clove, making it a perfect component for the Zombie's complex blend. Bacardí's own Zombie recipe calls for a mix of their Superior and Black rums.149  
* Alternative: Flor de Caña 7 Year Old Gran Reserva  
  While from Nicaragua, Flor de Caña 7 Year is an excellent example of the Spanish-heritage, column-still style of rum. It is a dry, medium-bodied rum with notes of caramel and nuts that works very well in this context.118  
* **UK Availability:** Bacardí Añejo Cuatro and Flor de Caña 7 Year are both widely available in UK supermarkets and specialist retailers.150

#### Demerara Rum

This refers to a specific style of rum from Guyana, known for its rich, dark sugar and smoky notes. An overproof version is traditionally called for.

* Top Recommendation (The Legend): Lemon Hart 151  
  Lemon Hart 151 is the legendary, high-proof Demerara rum specified by name in Donn Beach's original recipes.118 Its rich, complex flavour is considered by many aficionados to be essential and irreplaceable for an authentic Zombie.  
* Excellent Alternative: Plantation O.F.T.D. Rum  
  With Lemon Hart 151 being notoriously difficult to source, Plantation O.F.T.D. (Old Fashioned Traditional Dark) was created by a panel of tiki experts, including Jeff "Beachbum" Berry, to fill the gap. It is a blend of overproof rums from Guyana, Jamaica, and Barbados and is an outstanding substitute.118  
* **UK Availability:** Lemon Hart 151 has extremely poor and inconsistent availability in the UK.152 Plantation O.F.T.D. is much more readily available from UK specialist retailers like Amathus Drinks.158

#### Pernod

* Confirmation of Standard: Pernod  
  Pernod is the classic French anise-flavoured liqueur used for the final few drops in a Zombie.  
* **Alternatives:** Other anise liqueurs like **absinthe** or **Herbsaint** can be used in its place and are often found in modern Zombie recipes.159  
* **UK Availability:** Pernod is widely available in UK supermarkets.
